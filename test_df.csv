This review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. 

At BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50), Swapping out a left side (big ring) shifter on my down tube (this should have cost approx. $20 at most) and installing new bar tape (cost of tape $20 and $20 to install?)..

I bring the bike into BBB prior to the nice weather hitting Pittsburgh in hopes of trying what people have said is a great bike shop and getting my OCLV TREK 5900 ready for the season. Turns out I don't hear from these guys. A week goes by ...two weeks...I think that's ok I have two or three other bike I can turn to for a ride. Then I wind up going out of town for a week thinking for sure I'll get a call from them re: my bike is ready to roll...but no dice. So I call. Turns out a screw snapped when the mechanic was re-installing the down tube shifter and it had to be tapped out (is that my fault?). He says ""Should be ready in a few days"". So I come in a few days later to this mammoth bill. I ask if I am paying for the labor of taping out the screw? I don't think I ever got a straight answer? I look at the bill and can't see a good breakdown of the charges. Normally I would ""duke it over"" a bill like this but I figured...I had somewhere I to be 10 minutes ago and at least I finally have my bike. I would expect that for that money my bike could have been stripped down to the frame and totally gone over (overhauled). But it wasn't.  Well BBB I'll give you a star because the mechanic did do a good job in that my cycle shifts well and the tape job on the bars looks great (nice wrap).

LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg,2XuIpV9mGhR6OQQkjsSt1g,"This is the best bike store I've walked into.  Their primary focus is on racing bikes, but (as I'm not a racer) the service stays top notch in much lower price ranges.

Got greeted by the staff, and my girlfriend and I got the luxury of absolutely no pressure as we walked around and looked at bikes.  She explained what she was looking for, and the staff explained what they had and what price range she was looking at.  I wound up talking to another person working there, and let them try to find a bike that fit.  (I'm 6'8"", and as I found out, fit pretty well on an XXL Scott 65cm frame.)

Anyways, back to my girlfriend's experience.  What impressed me was after they had a bike they thought was a winner, they let her go on a test ride around the neighborhood there.  And then when she came back in two minutes, told her that wasn't ideal, and sent her back out, with instructions to take the second left and try it on a hill.  After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.

The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.

And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  

That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  

Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.


Edit, 4 years later: 

Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)

It's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.  Friends have terrific luck with Pittsburgh Pro, which is nearer,  and I'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, Big Bang is my absolute go-to.",0,4ykgzzzGEWjMD5lwk1-l9A,0,5,2/7/2009,review,0,,"This is the best bike store I've walked into.

After she figured out yes, that was the bike, the guy spent at least half an hour fitting the bike to her; he wound up switching out the stem, adding a seat with a little more travel, and getting everything just so.  There was no hurry.  There was no pressure.

The amount of interest that the staff showed in getting each person the just-so fit gets five stars; if you want a bike that fits, it's worth it to browse here.

And, update: I went out the other day, and asked for a price on a bike costing about 25% of the bike I tooled around on there two weeks ago.  Without batting an eye, and without a hint of bike snobbery, the owner ran off to figure out what it'd cost me.  I talked to him about the differences between a double and triple, and he spent twenty minutes explaining the pros and cons, and gave a strong suggestion on the double.  

That said, the price he quoted me was also 10% under the price quoted by another shop on the same exact bike.  I asked for the price of an upgrade to a single part on the new bike, and he quoted me about half the price I expected from doing research on the internet.  

Customer-friendly, well priced, super-high-quality bicycles.  A+++.


Edit, 4 years later: 

Glen, Beth, and the rest of the crew here are still there, and still awesome.  My girlfriend is now my wife.  My lowend Trek road bike now has more miles on it.  :-)

It's still a much longer drive to get to Big Bang, but for any work on my bike, I'm glad to make the drive.  Friends have terrific luck with Pittsburgh Pro, which is nearer,  and I'll occasionally stop there on a ride; that said, for drop-off-the-bike work, Big Bang is my absolute go-to., nan",2008-12,2,151,"['8ovU8AEmJa0I-aSqI6m4GA', 'EqJkg4-dABX0XMGcMox5KQ', 'rb94j6oofp84stiy6JAOcg', 'iCIL1xWfjqlHoFAWTDIsQg', 'FLxgiNF9rsiXR-zbEcWBRQ', 'Y1NQn63ZHR5emm9kQBZUxA', 'j3xp6UUzDvFCRWu9nwUTWw', 'v2TvkK2EnE3YskhigTKxVw', 'Jw0SF2bJ5mpGqvmivwFRNw', 'CXIMcQpNAhLO1hxgn9GxMg', '_ta-eVom-K35OpbtUKKW9A', 'p1X9p5YyDMpiw1rIlZybBA', '0H4meMIsgz4HTzSmq9MXSg', 'Co3ydbwnDC8KOtCM2f2BKg', 'HZFGv32L420JzkAba7HcOg', 'ooxpeo27Q6hXmixSZ80mcQ', 'bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ', '5xFl5TArWPHH4HhIPJUFDw', 'hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA']",,,5,,user,1,1,,3.77,1,[],Dean,74,,107,,1,238,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,"['Sporting Goods', 'Bikes', 'Shopping']",,,Big Bang Bicycles,FALSE,,,,,,,3,,FALSE,,,16,,PA,TRUE,,,FALSE,,"347 Lebanon Rd

Big Bang and owner Glenn couldn't have been more patient of all my questions and concerns.  His knowledge is remarkable and he took his time fitting me and explaining the process. He had several bikes I could demo in my size.  After deciding on a model to order Glenn, Craig, and Samson who I had the pleasure of working with, continued to help me through ordering the bike, getting it assembled upon delivery, and taking a significant amount of time going through the bike with me and how to maintain it properly. The shop has an amazing variety of helmets, clothing, and other things that a cyclists might want to purchase. Even though I live in the north hills, if I need anything from service to merchandise, I will not hesitate to go to Big Bang Bicycles.  Glenn and the others that work at the shop are well worth the trip., nan",2012-02,,5,[],,,0,,user,,,,3.67,,[],William,2,,0,,,4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TRUE,,,,,"['Sporting Goods', 'Bikes', 'Shopping']",,,Big Bang Bicycles,FALSE,,,,,,,3,,FALSE,,,16,,PA,TRUE,,,FALSE,,"347 Lebanon Rd

Oh Page's, How I love thee...
With your swirled frozen peaks
And sundaes covered in rainbow jimmies,
Leaves me smiling, cheek to cheek.

Page's has been a regular family outing as far back as I can remember and clearly the popularity doesn't stop with just my family. From opening day to closing you will find people willing to line up around the block to get their ice cream fix.

No other ice cream location in Pittsburgh even comes close to rivaling this outstanding soft serve experience. Our usual order consists of the basics: swirled soft serve (cup or cone) dipped in crunches or jimmies.

Not only do they have soft serve but also a wide variety of insane sundae creations and other novelties. And don't forget about the shaved ice - which comes in basically ever flavor you could imagine.

Then I go run for two hours to burn it off, but it's worth it.

We stopped in last night for the first time. There are soooooo many options. The menu itself is huge, then all around the windows they advertise even more options!! I couldn't get a good look at the menu because the line was long & heads were in the way. The next thing i know, it was my turn and i still couldn't decide. 

I asked if they had a brownie sundae and ordered that. Bobby said he was only thirsty and ordered a banana shake. 

I enjoyed my sundae but next time I will try something different that's on their menu. They had so many options for an arctic swirl so I'm looking forward to trying one of those next. Also, the banana split i noticed someone having was gigantic. Also, the ice cream itself on a cone even look delicious. I'm so glad to finally have access here and to live a 5 minute drive away!!",4,2PfavOTufsPCRdYm-bFcpw,0,4,5/29/2015,review,1,,"I've been waiting to try Page Dairy Mart because i live so close, but didnt have access until i recently bought my car.

T2GzjxlcatJyNiyU7gk_Eg,pN68yo01N4htznXwu7hpjw,"Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good, the selection is vast, and the price is right. They have so many different things to try, it's nearly impossible to choose. I'm a big fan of the cookie sundae, brownie sundae, and cinnamon roll sundae. The options at this place are pretty much endless. But sometimes a regular soft serve sugar cone is the way to go. It's better than Dairy Queen, AND you support a local business by going here. What more could you ask for. 

I don't know if I would say that Page's has particularly superior soft serve, but it's the experience and variety that makes this a four star place. I do think the ice cream is better than somewhere like Dairy Queen, but not by much. What makes Page's special is wide variety of options and soft serve flavors. It's also the nostalgia that goes along with it. It's a business that hasn't changed much in it's lifetime, and that's what most people like about it. You can count on Page's to be there every March-October. They're going to offer the same treats you loved as a kid for your whole lifetime.  It represents the change of the seasons and brings back memories for people. It means a lot more to people than just a summertime ice cream stop. 

For those who have never been there, there is no interior so you'll have to eat in your car or standing outside. I prefer to open the back of my SUV, sit there and enjoy the night while I eat my ice cream. The parking lot is hectic and downright scary sometimes. I typically avoid this place on busy nights just for that reason.

I look forward to my next visit to pittsburgh, so I can enjoy this place again!, nan",2012-01,88,361,"['_YI2xCPY90YqTazh-xL_Pg', 'UKn3yyuoEWM6g11wIr_bgw', 'vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g', 'llAtgO8Q4jJuU7NDU7mlWQ', 'DzVKlwlnqwSSiGGzLmAp_g', 'koYomf67VzeDv1OapN1w4Q', 'E221gu367rhRl0XdL19Lxw', 'nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA', '8E0DGec8LNn6oDmPHmj-mg', 'XqkwXtpzRAELSNNGM3XKOg', 'i2u6i8HWiVvMjcG5nwTAEA', 'd42T37_3iMNRrIbi1gq2_Q', 'tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A', 'mrmDFhLjEGOjSQT_GZgM_g', 'D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w', 'UTGqubcmDv1cNe5-k8-OeA', 'a56VaJVGI00zaJVG2bF60w', 'uPYixt1f_bxr_7-wFaCocA', 'iv_4_uUyYLPb0sxkaOPs4g', 'tUERuB2rGao5Vb2aEsL8Ng', 'QtR_2W99cRMardVgAVtvSA', 'HpjnJxRPx6gs9bShlXCVyg', 'r8nd1J5aXG1bL5ctt8ucCQ', '-8gZI-V7Uc-gJq5HnJCTtQ', 'bT-9l1QR_amDOfbYBk1_pg', 'KIsRjJ69tVeszhCv9rByxw', 'q8X9k4dyFsBeeDRf5Fq2rw', 'fHPunEN2GYq7zd-2Yj8WVQ', 'TlHwcEQwqwBychepTKd_wA', 'VRCl0XzcC3n5RzfuU3gu3w', 'n7kv-JmvZYjqRGyjkWmIjQ', 'z_Zb5ZggetvnuGoyX7RA0A', 'wYtCAzpt8fh9Cn2TOEq20A', 'mPN5eLiiF2nNwkDvhTiifg', 'mhrDDrS6LJpXJykFEuQ-RA', 'Tned5k-7SOWMbkqS_2d0jQ', 'mNZNp0oWTZVqZodO9klFTA', 'sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ', 'CBxEbUB-AXWND3n5O57AHg', '-3Fhjq38v4q_-JHS8o8Vsg', 'mDer46sgzwtL7v400KvKpg', 'STIk31We6d8KFMoZqOVEIQ', '11b3GOTx-57bYBVqBKA7rA', 'yPWj9W9lYnSXazgafWejyQ', 'uDVrgAX94cg2qndTSxsRqA', '8uhfS3p00BXRjFOR8y_klw', 'yo8RYHL6Plh83wVqRWzOag', 'GUfpBrRnAh8Ul5irur0cCw', 'bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ', 'NCotrIxIJK1IaDKCI9u4FQ', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', 'F18Ip1C8G0wVYFduIOpckw', '9snsct9e7oDJYXXBO4Q6-Q', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'HLO_gUjvY-Gf3HW4gJwvVw', 'A3Xa4KQWrzEcNVglYL97ng', 'w0KBFGSbdsUtfaQid2Jzbg', 'dHDeHCGZOAjCiiweg6EaVQ', 'KNZInqxr-DKR8NqMU0GHCw', '9-4jeDw4igWrG1iWOiPh0Q', 'euyIb-puNS_1RgxiA4mAdg', '8hq3SkiU6_PbuW6r8VUIHA', 'oe-WsgJPwwxzX7DyhFYNBw', 'A8OUdyp_QaM8w7yPUzQWWA', 'QMrKRZD4m7pxzF3phvfAww', 'M_bFa8vpvQ3UoGpuqXZmwQ', 'WnjpoLrmUCZneoDIznzpGg', 'yMkSo7ZSCCk_Oa7P47PeIQ', 'pT6oqgVR2MD1CmcLjMF1YA', 'cKEkbRkYcYtWymUF8Zxolw', 'gw70W6oa_wQoSTecAG4HOw', 'Wb4oEA6GiG3BiihN9TJNkQ', '-HB0DRmDqW8odBb-AIgikA', 'rlpfzdmhm1T34Pef0gzznQ', 'vz0m1IY0OrQaC0enm4aWBA', 'wOPSxFM0qyA6b2bsPM_baw', 'PThlPbeKCNyuHwaZVrvwTQ', 'Mi2RM4vWd2RTZgdm1XGKKw', 'J9PaWSON4ZChNERkDZtSww', 'BtmVuGehqCETrF2lfef6vw', '59A-ZxUMOgIl2MAnySh-Aw', 'WsJQZH0wr3_z2KuyNOYI9A', 'COzr-8aIK5zYxxhsW3-U1Q', 'ojmcCII774UQ84mz5CPs0w', 'CdXusNhIEfwM2nJaNxGqNw', 'Pk81Sf1k205hap-6wWFmMg', 'Y29u3bOPhcnOIw0DCkNlfg', 'M2z5kX2B2p_D-TLfEtqU7g', 'R7KdetFVtrsBk4MHP7h0uA', '2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg', 'qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ', 'rMJOADdPfdaGoT3CHHQRtg', 'ZsfdfE4Q5yh9U9SQdvJzHQ', 'Sqr_JvEAmbIvW-0dzUW-Og', '9meJxvjN0ATJ67-NDHT7Xg', 'RRK6JsOgWoQD3gtXKt42XA', 'ah9WWX1DO3UcxcYf_-M-sg', 'CVzcJApipXT-A357bhRy0g']",1,55,24,53,user,107,148,3,3.66,11,"[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",Shira,619,,470,20,48,1155,,,,10:00,,,,,10:00,,,,,,TRUE,,,10:00,,"['Food', 'Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt', 'Desserts']",,10:00,Page Dairy Mart,FALSE,,,,,,,1,,FALSE,,,74,,PA,FALSE,22:00,,FALSE,,"4600 E Carson St

If there's a type of ice cream or sundae or frozen dairy concoction you love they got it.  From blend ins to banana splits and hot fudge sundaes and flavored soft serve.  Speaking of, you can combine flavors which I just learned of and blended peanut butter and banana, it tasted exactly how I had hoped.

This place gets ridiculously busy on a hot day so be ready to stand in line for a half hour if its one of those days.  While you stand in line copy and paste the info below into YouTube

If there's a type of ice cream or sundae or frozen dairy concoction you love they got it.  From blend ins to banana splits and hot fudge sundaes and flavored soft serve.  Speaking of, you can combine flavors which I just learned of and blended peanut butter and banana, it tasted exactly how I had hoped.

This place gets ridiculously busy on a hot day so be ready to stand in line for a half hour if its one of those days.  While you stand in line copy and paste the info below into YouTube

sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg,C9p5UvH_DkdRjrl61H-xcQ,"Considering my absolute love for sweets - and more specifically, ice cream - it just doesn't make sense that it took me nearly 6 years of living in Pittsburgh to go to Page Dairy Mart. The only bad thing is that it's too close to where we live, so I can expect my sugar intake to go through the roof now.

As you walk up, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the signage and menu, as they seem to have everything that you could ever imagine. In fact, you might just be better off walking up and ordering whatever you want without looking at the menu. Odds are, they'll just smile and run off to make it. I mean, if they have toasted coconut soft serve ice cream, what don't they have, right?

The people that work there are all really pleasant and the ice cream is excellent! It is cash only, so that might be a downside if you're just randomly stopping by for the first time, but it's one place where the long lines are truly warranted in this town. Don't worry, though, usually the line isn't actually long at all. They take your order quickly at Page and your order will actually be up impressively fast for the amount of people ordering thanks to Page Dairy Mart's army of ice cream servers on staff. That ""line"" of people will disappear as quickly as a new one appears.

A night hasn't gone by since our first visit that my wife and I haven't wanted to go back. Only our conscious willpower has kept us away, and there aren't a lot of places that have left me feeling that way, so kudos to Page Dairy Mart and their staff!

Every time I see this type of privately run ice cream shop it reminds me of home and lazy summer days with my girlfriends. Riding bikes to the local pool, playing at the beach on lakeside, or causing a ruckus at the Whippy Dip! Oh, sooo serious summer romances... flirting with boys while throwing ice from our slushies was a regular occurrence.

Finally, a warm spring day on the books and the only place I want to go is The Page. The location is so weird! Under this huge bridge away from any greenery or picnic tables next to a low end used car dealer. I suggest grabbing your food and heading elsewhere. There is always some sort of line and it gets worse on the weekend. These guys and gals are pros when it comes to ice cream and will recite all the flavors with speed that you might miss them. It's kind of like the Cheese steak place in Philly. Know your order when you get to the counter, pay, and move OVER!

They have so many flavors of ice cream! The menu is extensive, you can get anything here, brgrs, fries, hot fudge brownie sundae, or a banana split!

Although I was really impressed by the different flavors of soft serve and that they are all homemade, I saw the sign for the apple dumpling sundae so I opted for that instead. My aunt went with a classic chocolate shake. 

The sundae is massive and the ice cream was so good, some of the best vanilla that I've had. Only critique is that the core part of the dessert were canned and were too sweet and sugary(- a star)

I have a small appetite and can't usually finish most things - so when I ordered my burger and fries I let the bf know he was expected to finish it for me.

I've never been a fan of soft serve or gone out of my way for it, but this place will make you do just that. Not to mention the fresh squeezed lemonade made to order (yes, they squeeze the lemons right into your cup.) Burgers and fries are also made to order, so be prepared for a short wait while you prepare mentally for the heaven you're about to consume. I'm not a fan of their fries (they tasted like they were made in old grease) but wow that cheeseburger. I have a small appetite and can't usually finish most things - so when I ordered my burger and fries I let the bf know he was expected to finish it for me. Little did we know he wouldn't get any of that delicious burger, because the second I took the first bite the rest magically disappeared. 

Oh! They also have old fashioned dip cones which are one of my favs.

Hidden between the Waterfront and Southside in a pretty random area, it's pretty easy to miss this place. Surrounded by hills and located under a bridge. The only other thing nearby is a car place. But this is Pittsburgh, it seems to me that some of the best things in the city are hidden.

Ice cream is soft serve and is your pretty standard good ice cream: creamy, soft, cold, with authentic flavors. It's delicious. But honestly, good ice cream can be found in many places in Pittsburgh.

So what makes this place stand out from all the other ice cream places in Pittsburgh is the fact that they have delicious sundaes. My favorite is the cookie sundae, which has fresh-out-of-the-oven-melt-in-your-mouth cookies on top of a mountain of ice cream and hot fudge. They use Nancy B's bakery cookies. Yum.

The menu is HUGE. So no, I haven't tried everything. Also, I've found love in the cookie sundae, so I may just stick to that.

Anyhow, I have mixed feelings.  One, it's a huge buffet.  Two, it's cheap (8.99 for dinner, maybe 7.99? for lunch) and includes all you can drink soda, chai, etc.  Three, mango lassi is part of the buffet.  Four, the food on the buffet can be very strange.  

So, pricewise, when you include free drinks/mango lassi, it's damn worth it, as long as you can find two or three other items you like.  On the other hand, you may not like anything at all on the buffet.  

Their nan is average in texture but has garlic and herbs, so it's now foccacia nan and tastes delicious.  Papadum is done well.  Lamb kabobs are good, but I wish they had lamb curry.  Their selection of meat is small relative to the size of the buffet.

On the other hand, they have plenty of vegetarian items, but I prefer to avoid cream, butter and cheese that I didn't eat much of them.  I did try the spinach and they have the most wonderful version of spinach: it's cheesy spinach (but doesn't look like there's melted cheese in it).  Awesome.  

But then again, their chickpeas were in a sauce that tasted like a combination of spaghetti sauce and ketchup-- yuck!

I suppose this place is geared to fat vegetarians who can have dairy.  Oh, and the atmosphere is pretty lonesome.  It was probably once the grand dining hall of the hotel and now kinda ghostly.

#NAME?,oh90Ere3wmj3u8Obnmoh7w,"This place is crazy! It's an Indian restaurant located within a Days Inn. I love it because it's so quirky. Go for the buffet. Don't bother with the menu. The buffet is just as unique as the location of the restaurant. They usually have several vegetarian options and some meat options also. 

What makes this buffet so different is the fact that it has malai kofta, pickled toppings, and self serve mango lassi. I have never seen any of the above mentioned items on a buffet.

The taste is not the best and sometimes the food comes off as warmed over, but it is good and so much fun to stop in and stuff your belly with as much or as little as you like, all while sitting in such an unusual location.",0,8tBfgYCI6Fz9xrSYCYCYXA,0,3,6/8/2009,review,0,,"This place is crazy!

Sketchy looking building. Check.
Enter through a kitchen and dine in someone's living room. Check.
Eat Hungarian food from an older man who makes everything in said kitchen. Check.
Communal dinning with strangers. Check.

It's definitely a one of a kind experience. So for $15 you get 6 courses. Yep, that's right... SIX! And seriously, all the second helpings you could ever want. They literally tell you to clear off the plate or bowl before removing it from the table! 

It was a packed house, with three parties of 8-10 people, and then we were the odd ""man"" out with a party of 5. The problem was, the tables sat about 12, so we had to split up between two tables. Not necessarily ideal, but we made it work. Especially because the 2 of us who has together had a pretty fun table to converse with... I don't think that can be said for the other 3. But my only real suggestion for the place is to schedule the seating a little better.

I don't even know where to start with all the food. Some dishes were really really good, while others were just okay. Maybe I'll start with the okay. The first dish, the fried dough and mushrooms (sorry if there's a proper Hungarian name for this that I don't know) was just okay. The mushrooms tasted like they had come out of a can. Maybe they didn't, but they weren't flavored very well. The peasant soup was good. It was peppery, which I appreciate and tasted more like chicken noodle soup.

Everything else, I can say, was very tasty. I didn't realize Hungarian culture shares Haluski as a dish. I love Haluski, but think it can easily be bland. Not with this. Again, it had enough pepper and even salt to satisfy me. The sauerkraut and pork was great and the pork was very tender. I'm not even a big pork fan and thought it was good. But the thing I will remember the most is the goulash and chicken. I NEVER order chicken at restaurants. I don't like cooking it at home. I'm just not a big fan. But this was the best, most flavorful and tender chicken I've ever had. It was delicious! That is saying a lot from me, an anti-chicken gal! 

It was really cool at the end because Alex, the owner and cook, came out and talked about Hungarian history. You think about how America has become such a melting pot, you don't know if you'll get this kind of experience a decade from now. It just was very heartwarming to hear him speak so passionately about Hungarian culture.",5,DhwPdZ-67IgFc_XcVS30BA,1,4,3/18/2014,review,6,,"There's always a first time for things, and this is a first in my book...

f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA,lnNJKfs4tDVCduRy1Nt9XA,"I decided on Josza's corner for a big family dinner to celebrate my grandmother's birthday. She does not like going out to fancy/expensive places so, after reading the reviews and finding out that after some research on ancestry.com she may be at least 50% Hungarian, I called Alex to make reservations for a Sunday, 12 people. 
When I read the reviews, I thought that I had a good idea of what it would be like but, to be honest, I was taken aback when we arrived. To say that building was old would be the understatement of the century. My family was surprised and a little worried after seeing the outside of the building. This is not your typical chain restaurant set up. This is what I would consider authentic. If you went to visit your long lost relatives in Hungary and great grandma welcomed you to her home to serve you a big meal, this is probably what her house would look like. The fact that the restaurant shows its age and its use made it more real for me. But don't expect frills and thrills. That's the food's job.
 You have to walk through the small kitchen to get to the back room where three long tables are set up. The tables are covered in plastic table cloths and there are plastic utensils and styrofoam plates in the middle. The room is filled with pictures, knick knacks and other memorabilia. Alex also turned on some authentic music for ambience.
We opened the wine we brought and loosened our belts. Then the food started. Served family style. Appetizers were first. Amazing flat bread, cabbage salad and a tomato/pepper soupy concoction that blew me away. Next course: peasant soup. Think the warm, flavorful chicken soup grandma would make you from scratch when you were sick. Warms the soul. Next up: cabbage and noodles. My favorite with a few spices for a little kick on the classic. Then the entrees came. Transylvanian pork with cabbage and served with bread. Then a chicken dish with noodles. After all of the food was served, Alex came out with a plate of dessert-crepe/tortilla type bread with chocolate chips and dates. Alex then answered our questions about history and culture. All of this for 20$ a person. We added a little extra for an extra tip. All in all, my family embraced the experience and had a wonderful time leaving full, happy and with an appreciation for all the wonderful things we have today.",0,DhwPdZ-67IgFc_XcVS30BA,0,4,9/17/2013,review,0,,"I decided on Josza's corner for a big family dinner to celebrate my grandmother's birthday.

The proprietor, Alex, is very friendly and talkative and introduces himself upon your arrival. The food is whatever he has decided to prepare for you and comes out in multiple courses served family style. There's definitely more food than can be consumed reasonably, so make sure to save room during the earlier courses for the later courses. At the end, he will provide containers to take leftovers home.

As this was my first experience with Hungarian food, I wasn't sure what to expect, so I was pleased that I enjoyed ALL of the dishes! The restaurant doesn't hold standard hours, so you need to call ahead to make a reservation. When you call, you can provide dietary restrictions, e.g. indicating that you would prefer vegetarian versions of the dishes. If you enjoy wine with dinner, make sure to BYOB. There is no corkage fee. 

My only minor complaint with the setup is the waste of styrofoam dishes and plastic utensils, and the fact that it's not as nice to eat with them as compared to real dishes/utensils. Also, just set your expectations properly, don't expect a fancy set up.

He shares with you stores of how his Hungarian grandmother made the dishes and he strives to keep the dishes traditional. We learned how he keeps his crepes fluffy, and bread soft, and seasons his dishes to savory perfection. 

The atmosphere is homey with embroidered Hungarian wall hangings, and old world kitchen and a Victorian couch I dubbed the ""fainting couch"" because we were all so full I was sure I needed to lay down before the last course.

The food is savory and peasant style, this means meat, sauce or juice lots of spices and egg noodles. Seems to be a balance of salty cabbage, maybe paprika and cumin, chicken and i believe beef were in the main dishes. Lots of homemade bread for dunking. A cucumber salty, almost pickled salad with dill and sour cream. Crepes and cookies for desert mm and a very sweet traditional toast to our birthday girl.

Tips: if you run out of food ask for more! he is happy to bring out more bowls full, 

park around the back on the other side of train tracks, you'll see what I mean when you get there.

BYOB, red or white wine go well with these dishes.

Plan for at least two hours or three hours..... ever eaten a course meal in France?
It is kind of like that, no? Then just plan for 3 hours you'll need to pace yourself and he cooks as you eat.

We paid 20$ per person, this included the tip.

The owner is extremely sweet and will talk you through the dishes if you have questions., nan",2009-07,46,397,"['_e5drmTJBSV0yiFBrTimtg', 'B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA', 'D3JoaaL9kEgnIs64SUOR2w', '10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg', 'fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ', 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw', '_7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ', 'VxT0Op5Q_F05Tcg3N6dluw', 'K4gesBrHsnLDv9punvovSA', 'hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w', 'G_BvSxt71MqF_x4jgEyqSA', 'dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA', '_ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw', 'dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg', 'b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA', '4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg', 'T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ', '7xH9Qey07WJYq5E1sFxo_g', 'yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q', 'sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw', 'uNEUDSbFeNL_-ReWEz0PkQ', '5h8l-jqqDS2Cc8pFy3vMOQ', 'clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg', 'o0kJOAU7Igw5XjVAHrRBaw', 'WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg', 'Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw', 'pRyrLnk2ayyAdeZRsh5kVQ', '-Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg', 'scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg', 'xZvRLPJ1ixhFVomkXSfXAw', 'Xa3BWCmQFigPcdPx2Js0rg', 'L53iEBBSW1gOXQX_OqPRwg', 'AYGHNy8gPxl2Q-etTT3hZw', 'yif0dBUdq0SRZPVvnY2Ncg', 'aROP9D7ev2JMQTBWit-kYg', 'iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ', '6IHcb7PC6qiYR9qEsBieVQ', 'jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA', '5kdP7u5eO-jU7WWTKsyLcw', 'FlujvsaLHpX3pVv2AIxN5A', 'iSJLdur495--oPDE0b1Vpw', 'Wn9BnqTdBoM2TwZ99jcOww', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', 'N_cH3QA_eXXmnzz-nzEeKA', '0nteHJaKb55_uS_BDAoqFA', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'AtLRo5Dx0ir00RK_3lhxKQ', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'gwnVSev8aNLvMArs3WTfFw', 'wF2GUprZUxRi2DIInefH-w', 'DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ', 'S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA', '7PDm_RG8tTTKrauImGbPuQ', 'T9YpJSehLEyPgab1o8eWHw', 'gZrOmKBM2xYZNXCDImfyCg', 'F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA', 'QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg', 'RDtp7XSLcvBt3AbOxjtYaA', 'RsaEvod4EOBYIdbRBBv0sw', 'ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ', '4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A', 'AjBhNARc8TdGpRbZWEe4wA', 'FQ9WxmtoXqDFkrjDPMmGsg', 'Pc2ezRRHcXUXWXmZutQPeg', '4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg', 'xSyjJmHMYyoutsNznUWTqw', 'ZUigPfy-OUDibkyxSuK22w', 'eNzSkY0YWpWIr30ijzliZw', '-LXOoP1lkinLgwrmx_WY9g', '_8WRSGHw6lHgchVK3Apqgg', 'pRdP2DbOwLpyaT0CVfM13Q', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', 'ybmr49qtfGZtco2RE6LJiQ', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', 'SDXX0zuyJHKPZzsQtUIUIg', 'dGEAzFX7dZO7pZulTPvIzA', 'EPJQn99DReBqJZ7fTYXpew', 'fhNxoMwwTipzjO8A9LFe8Q', 'qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ', 'FNGhSvqmoGHPvCTcia8RPQ', 'fmPsZ6K1YQasSdwMCw_GRA', 'UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g', 'DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg', 'WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg', 'RDSBW5Y0SacrCXRg8J1d2w', '5TxzUPJ0b6kPaJKSioA_iA', 'jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA', 'c3P8lRnyv_beqsg_efD0ew', 'qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 'A70xwjN71W6DIfB72jJfGg', 'WLwOZY9tQHfOk0OUkA2J6A', 'ClRQ6zIZwj9fmbGHmWjfJA', '00Wk3YgWoBk4QO9xf_zxOw', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', '5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q', '99uSnMeITb49bzd1esGAGw', 'ReNdhXFegddLzr5BTF42ww', 'VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ', 'kUgosZyBnvu1Paw6YoJJ1w', 'xyx-T7vBQJ8vz532rf45WQ', 'WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA']",,41,13,25,user,67,92,2,3.8,2,"[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",Serena,275,,219,1,26,823,TRUE,,,11:00,,,,TRUE,11:00,FALSE,FALSE,none,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,11:00,FALSE,"['Hungarian', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,11:00,Jozsa Corner,TRUE,FALSE,yes_free,,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,,,26,,PA,FALSE,18:00,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"4800 2nd Ave

q4_kY8bBeigYPVS0Ak7QGg,1qmUiS2PxxAC9_ML5FCGrQ,"I feel like I'll be dodging arrows on this review, but it needs to happen.

I've been wanting to try Jozsa's for almost two years after the barrage of positive vibes I've heard from multiple people.  So when we were looking for a quiet, unique and BYOB spot for Mother's Day, the perfect opportunity presented itself.

I called Alex a few weeks prior, and after an impromptu conversation about everything from my last name to his friends that were in the area, I managed to secure a reservation for 7 at 5pm.  Needless to say, I was thrilled given his hours can be inconsistent and it all depends on whether he ""has people in.""

Driving up to Jozsa's, I had already expected it to be run-down and sketchy, but even it pushed my comfort zone a little.  After parking our car, I was completely relieved when we walked in (weren't exactly sure if we were even entering the front door) and were greeted by Alex in all of his Hungarian hospitality...  that hospitality (and perhaps his food) is about all that prevented this from being a rare 1-star review.

When I told Alex we were here for our 5pm reservation, I immediately knew something was wrong.  After confirming that we in-fact had made a reservation, Alex let us know that ""something had gone wrong"" and there were way more people than he had expected.  Peering into the dining room, I've never seen more people packed into such a small space (and I could see the discontent brewing).  As he didn't want to turn us away, they wedged a table in the corner of the kitchen semi-under the standing counter.  After wedging us in (my brother and I had to lean forward the entire meal so that we weren't hitting our heads on the counter behind us and my mother's chair was up against the front door) ANOTHER group of 5 walked in with reservations as well.  While I didn't see the aftermath of their placement, Alex mentioned he was going to squeeze them in with another table of 7 in the dining room (I honestly don't know how he did).

Finally seated, I was excited to try the food.  When I talked to Alex on the phone, he confirmed what many had told me in that it would be a multi-course Hungarian meal for $15 pp.  The courses were as follows:

1.  Mushrooms and fried dough
2.  Cabbage and noodles
3.  Pork and bread
4.  Cucumber salad
5.  Dessert (more fried dough, some nuts, and some craisins w/ powdered sugar)

While I could of passed the first course (the mushrooms were definitely from a can and the dough would of been much better if it were warm), the second and third completely reminded me of my grandmother's Polish cooking...  to die for.  After that however, the cucumber salad and dessert (if you could even call it that) were definitely a miss.

During the entire meal, Alex exhibited an almost a bi-polar personality.  With the other cook in the kitchen, he awkwardly berated her in front of us.  But while interacting directly with us, he was the sweet big old Hungarian man that I had heard so much positive praise about.

As we were getting ready to pay our bill, some of the other tables from the dining room began to leave (we'd know because my mother had to slide her chair forward to let them out every time).  It was at this point, Alex went on what I can only call a hunt for his money...  more or less interrogating everyone as they left to see if they paid and how much.  After an extremely disgruntled party left (I believe it was the 7 that got crammed with the bonus party of 5), it came our turn to pay and leave.

""$20 plus tip please.""

What?  So much for that $15 he mentioned on the phone (and on his menu).  I don't know if he jacked the price up for Mother's Day or what, but at this point I didn't feel like arguing in front of the family (it already had reached enough of an awkward point) so I got the cash and gave it to Alex.  As we were leaving, he pleaded us to return and kind of refused to stop talking and let us go (kind of that awkward interaction everyone has dealt with from a grandmother and grandfather in their lifetime).

Overall, we gave Jozsa's every shot to be the place we wanted it to be.  We even considered early on in the meal bringing the wife's family for another excursion at some point in the future.  I don't know if it was just a bad experience due to Mother's Day, the overbooking or both, but it was bad enough that we likely won't give Jozsa Corner another shot in the future.",1,DhwPdZ-67IgFc_XcVS30BA,1,2,5/14/2014,review,5,,"I feel like I'll be dodging arrows on this review, but it needs to happen.

Alex came out with a candle and birthday wishes in Hungarian, and the whole restaurant sang to me. We brought a cake, and passed around the extra once our table had gotten some.

Qs5dcst13DnQJwaBcR4VGg,RhtsWO6vXbauUN20o6XBLg,"I wanted to like this chain, I really did... but after disappointing visits to the Mt Lebanon location (soggy fries in greasy drippy paper cones), to Settlers Ridge where we were the first table seated but it still took almost 40 minutes to get our burgers and even then they missed the most important ingredient of my Ghost Pepper Style Burger (then delivered it in a portion cup on the side) to my most recent visit to this Waterworks/Homestead one- I GIVE UP...!  

First off- it was a Tuesday evening and it wasn't crowded.  We were seated pretty quickly and offered menu's by the hostess.  The waitress came by a second or 2 later and asked us if we were ready to order.  WHAT?  We didn't even get drinks yet.  We told her we were going to look over the menu but could she please get us 2 tall Coors Light drafts.  Seeing the bar from our table I noticed that there wasn't a bartender behind it.  There wasn't any customers seated there so I guess that's 'protocol'.  Anyway, our waitress goes away with our drink order and goes behind the waitress station to put our order in.  She comes back about 10 minutes later ( after my wife & I each alternately used the washroom & washed up) and asks if we're ready to order yet.  I ask her if they're still doing the Tavern Tuesday Deal and she says ""No, they stopped that weeks ago"" which I know is a lie because I get the e-mails every Tuesday Morning.  I asked her about our drinks and she says, ""I have no idea what's taking your drinks so long..."" which I reply, ""It's probably because you don't have a bartender over there...""  She shakes her head and walks away.  Still no movement over to the bar so I get up & walk over there myself.  No one seems to notice me and just as I am prepared to grab 2 glasses off the bartop to fill them myself- a Bartender appears...!  She asks if she can help me and I tell her I'm at a table 'over there' and ""...I've been waiting for beers for over 15 minutes with an empty bar...""  She pours my beers and I return to the table.  The waitress comes by about 5 minutes later, sees the beers, doesn't say a word, and keeps walking.  Our burgers come out about 10 minutes later, accompanied by their 'bottomless fries' which amount to 9 fries on my wife's plate (in a silly cone) and 11 on mine.  WTH...?

Btw. Our visit was on Nov 10 if anyone cares...",1,AlvGCHZX0n5puR9eZSZ4lg,1,1,11/23/2015,review,1,,"I wanted to like this chain, I really did... but after disappointing visits to the Mt Lebanon location (soggy fries in greasy drippy paper cones), to Settlers Ridge where we were the first table seated but it still took almost 40 minutes to get our burgers and even then they missed the most important ingredient of my Ghost Pepper Style Burger (then delivered it in a portion cup on the side) to my most recent visit to this Waterworks/Homestead one- I GIVE UP...!  

First off- it was a Tuesday evening and it wasn't crowded.  We were seated pretty quickly and offered menu's by the hostess.  The waitress came by a second or 2 later and asked us if we were ready to order.  WHAT?  We didn't even get drinks yet.  We told her we were going to look over the menu but could she please get us 2 tall Coors Light drafts.  Seeing the bar from our table I noticed that there wasn't a bartender behind it.  There wasn't any customers seated there so I guess that's 'protocol'.  Anyway, our waitress goes away with our drink order and goes behind the waitress station to put our order in.  She comes back about 10 minutes later ( after my wife & I each alternately used the washroom & washed up) and asks if we're ready to order yet.  I ask her if they're still doing the Tavern Tuesday Deal and she says ""No, they stopped that weeks ago"" which I know is a lie because I get the e-mails every Tuesday Morning.  I asked her about our drinks and she says, ""I have no idea what's taking your drinks so long..."" which I reply, ""It's probably because you don't have a bartender over there...""  She shakes her head and walks away.  Still no movement over to the bar so I get up & walk over there myself.  No one seems to notice me and just as I am prepared to grab 2 glasses off the bartop to fill them myself- a Bartender appears...!  She asks if she can help me and I tell her I'm at a table 'over there' and ""...I've been waiting for beers for over 15 minutes with an empty bar...""  She pours my beers and I return to the table.  The waitress comes by about 5 minutes later, sees the beers, doesn't say a word, and keeps walking.  Our burgers come out about 10 minutes later, accompanied by their 'bottomless fries' which amount to 9 fries on my wife's plate (in a silly cone) and 11 on mine.  WTH...?  I immediately requested a second batch.  At least at the Settlers Ridge location- they brought out the fries when they were ready and didn't leave them sit there to get cold & soggy while the burgers cooked.

To me, it seems like they haven't cleaned off the grill or something.  Evey thing seems to be filled with tons of grease now.

I use to love the bottomless fries, but not so much anymore.  That says something coming from a potato lover.  

It's like this place feel into a rut and cannot get out.  Like they became too comfortable in what they do and just decided one day that what they do will remain the same and people's attitudes won't change.

I do give you big props on the now endless root beer float.  But my burger was kind of blah.  I ordered the Royal Red Robin and thought it'll be great.  I've had it before, and this time I was so underwhelmed I could have stopped on my way home at a fast food joint and been more satisfied.  The egg reminded me of a plastic one you see in a kids toy set.  I'm sure if I were to have dropped it, it would have bounce.  The bacon was undercooked and so chewy that I pulled it off the burger and discarded it.  Even the tomato on the burger was making me want to gag.

I remember when the place first opened and I was one of their first customers.  It was pretty amazing and dazzling to be inside, but now I feel like this place has turned into Chuck E Cheese for adults...it's lost its luster.",0,AlvGCHZX0n5puR9eZSZ4lg,0,3,10/3/2013,review,1,,"I'm a fan of this place, but something is lacking here.

T2GzjxlcatJyNiyU7gk_Eg,LX7TQdYvrMR0XOyzfXXb9w,"It's been at least a year since the last time I was at a Red Robin, so it was practically like going in for the first time after so long. 

The service was excellent. Our server was very quick, friendly, and genuine. God bless anyone working at a service job at the Waterfront during the holiday season that can even fake a friendly attitude, much less be genuinely sweet. It was refreshing (not that I even can blame the grumpy servers at this time of year). Our food also came out unbelievably, especially for a burger place. It usually feels like forever for your food to come out at a place like this because you have to wait for all the burgers to be cooked just right. I honestly didn't even believe it was our food. 

If you don't know, Red Robin is known for its burger selection. They've got a lot of interesting choices that include chicken and vegetarian options. I got the Chili Chili Cheese Burger. It's no secret that I love pretty much chili cheese anything. I asked for no pink in the middle. The burger was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overdone, but there was no pink. It was tender and flavorful. On the burger was chili and cheddar cheese (obviously), raw red onions (which I could have done without. They didn't add much flavor, and the chunks were a little big so it added a weird crunch to the burger. I'm also not a huge fan of raw onions. So I may be biased), and a chipotle sauce. The burger was much spicier than I anticipated. It wasn't an overwhelming heat. It was more of a flavorful warmth. Though, be warned, if you don't do well even with mild-medium heat, I'd stay away from this one. The burger was around $11, but I definitely think it was worth the $11. 

Red Robin serves bottomless steak fries with all of their dishes. The fries were also cooked perfectly. They were warm and golden, but not overly crispy...or even worse, limp. Our server was wonderful and frequently checked if we wanted more fries. 


This isn't the kind of place I'm dying to go back to. I wouldn't say it's anything special considering it's just another burger chain, but they do what they do well. They're fast, friendly, efficient, and prepare their food well. It's definitely a good experience! Though generally I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, I'm sure I'll be back when the craving monster strikes.",2,AlvGCHZX0n5puR9eZSZ4lg,0,4,12/12/2014,review,3,,"It's been at least a year since the last time I was at a Red Robin, so it was practically like going in for the first time after so long.

PROS:  
Great Staff at all locations, every time that we've gone.
Food is okay (not awesome, but good)
Endless fries are always a win!
Unique atmosphere, sort of retro diner-esque.

CONS:
It is just sandwiches, but really that's what the restaurant is (to call it a ""con"" is debatable and sort of unfair).

Not sure if this is a pro or con, but its very kid-friendly and kid-oriented, IMO


The ""salmon"" burger was good (its actually pieces of salmon filet (not ground salmon patties), and I ordered some teriyaki sauce on the side--it was pretty darn tasty!
The Roast Beef au jus Sandwich was pretty good too--loads of meat!",0,AlvGCHZX0n5puR9eZSZ4lg,0,3,8/1/2010,review,2,,"Not too bad; I'd say its geared more towards kids, though.

The Roast Beef au jus Sandwich was pretty good too--loads of meat!, nan",2009-07,40,195,"['Hk3Vx_voj5dQ66P_NgMkEA', 'HKnZ2i_fLupIiT05QDAaYw', 'cJ0ku6SNwO4FX6Du3i2hiw', 'W6HwH-IDrlmT-K1K618jqA', 'kGgAARL2UmvCcTRfiscjug', 'JTXYStZUmPBo0Bn7JAAveA', '65j7bRPXJUkrUCQ7XGteDQ', 'wNtyBJa_qaRYUew_TWplgw', 'uiMTavYKLw9hxskV4xB2tg', 'B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA', '3OSdNpHA1p6LQ7ToS_rDJA', 'pQzgRCqPBD4iJnLkG3IFwQ', 'tn0EqWiKmv_wogIQvarX4A', 'olzm5hG4BBdFLBQJZ16rkQ', 'fYVbxoSM9sT2Klzi0uNhKw', 'gQta9kx5RKLpYk0ywxUDxg', 'Pzi8KFogQaOX2Qykaciddg', '10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg', 'fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ', '45DGEQLhKPYqMO3-dwuqfw', 'fC6WA3YL9AP7Ef9fiLn21Q', 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw', '_7Lg8iTWpFc0O7PEA8FmbQ', 't3Lx-b3ANrkF8MQnBiJFPw', 'm2rJWMkMl70kNUFwxZROyg', 'hEk0VssowoyeEF2R0ZB-7w', 'dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA', '_ZuylBniwr0G3xoZ5-IhNw', 'GSxzlK08BgEIzFeoq0aN-Q', 'b9WOuVFcnHxEGYXWdCeIVA', '4cW3iQW6JD1C8VxYP0eyXg', 'T_wjLgPOPXry7Bea4MzoVQ', 'YTHnhkhUY9m83m915xsjJg', '7ffOjgAG5au2IyZGLajsmg', 'yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q', '6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA', 'sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw', 'KZEGLZ5zM9Jh4Yy94_4LBA', 'clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg', 'nCWGxG52wUqXGQ7L_y5AVQ', 'oSo_3ARkzud3Wjc7evC2tg', 'D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg', 'gSuWU6taLeqtNIIFe5A_FA', 'x_iuUx5mjkEVLbfK6Mh6dw', 'fXJxPhEIeH9PM5mP3wD4_w', 'dtd-wIGTJl7QVWpCA-3_Cw', '-Sjhodaq2F0vPXXmQv1FJg', '072tu2_MFWmw-jb1O6DQYg', 'scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg', 'mXJS_e-zR68eExLhMrxJPA', 'sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ', 'FyCBkNXwoI_6X6apbslg4g', 'oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg', '_gA5BmEB4PRR2QsZFSOdpw', 'njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A', 'L53iEBBSW1gOXQX_OqPRwg', 'IEQlakFYC4Q7K3WXEajaSQ', '1t4hxOeOyRXUgCiu7JvxFg', 'aROP9D7ev2JMQTBWit-kYg', 'OD1zfOrexwZoxJjTowGDfw', 'iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ', 'f8tF2YduZI0IxS61Lji_Mw', 'yfH0ksVwjGmnYuJfUimBJQ', 'zWli0lD5TNKpTSHjXWdHxA', 'jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA', 'EO_ELhqprZNXUSrxC-D0BA', 'FlujvsaLHpX3pVv2AIxN5A', '86lPnxq14I4n2STeK07FEw', '_vS9qNQvx8wVUOIkj4qfAg', 'nIeP3W-5Tb8ByTB5oC1Uag', 'NXl0XdzZoRTq_f3K7bbOOg', 'iSJLdur495--oPDE0b1Vpw', '0LzlRSXLhEsVSWFEvW_5yg', 'SzS-LLPzJ7h7dh4H3bwV8w', '6wvlM5L4_EroGXbnb_92xQ', '-ke0O45_B6STtEqd5s_ANw', 'dNvGmCi5ui-BDx0o6-WHWg', 'SSXDBAaz6Y12Mawmi2eHNw', 'UwIRln7JG0ArX1UMd-pzoQ', 'FGgUPlz354JSESpN1zF2xA', 'xqdZ9oI3e9Va1n_sVqDplA', 'bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ', 'KaK3Wif-oNsCReSgQYS1AQ', 'q7MrNVt1FE23rwtWmPYWHg', '_f-Vd7RXlwd03jEzzLetOg', 'ObYBbapQShoG4zjDR1gSXw', 'YV-3bIVYRORpFhsqUvljmg', 'K_nrZRDnIM1LH1HPVX1_6Q', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ', 'HPyUAXN-Srx-VVPpznzHmg', 'qPGLUQUG43b3aBZKDUBlMw', 'iEBWD8HuAwEHT3Qv6SYbFA', 'oADRnUMH5giOABAYwCGAVg', 'fM6gyradMzwc-cREb5Zi_w', '2rFQo6MBsLcWCtojztyn3Q', 'FvfKgrunRKYLCZ4u4-Gicg', 'M35MTKk2N-yJSsPQYBM51A', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ', 'S5dRUvL8K9w34KOASgm0xA', 'cN_ZGu1ISXyGwW5qIxcRLA', 'fWdZAtSjlqtt1tkDlVdnyg', 'WPG2gqOOn_ve5Xe5cT7oOQ', 'olKIOr2PVh0gLcblu2ZONg', 'QcGi0cDzzGLb3LmiI33Psg', 'ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ', 'I91BcxNgrxwGYe0wtGCzVQ', 'cvQenf4GS1SOadB5g5Qd0A', 'bSkco4ZdB7REFtDsJUVrDA', 'ilLFHWdntX8i8TXosYZ2OA', 'Jy4pAsM5Pzgsz4jGwGYHTQ', 'xSyjJmHMYyoutsNznUWTqw', 'iOQt-pwKuWb-vR01NY0tlw', 'aAWjwzgfuc_pZ_3L_xnpdA', '0eonA8U6IWkIk6SRyAtiXg', 'ylIgegaQaJOjL4_lH2EkFA', 'FewyyLLtQ_95uE3soZDPLA', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', 'CHw1HVGJE0fDY_-5keDKGw', 'e7iHB7gZbVuD-UvJVKe3cQ', 'fKaImMGusDVL7PhavCBcyA', 'IxyQQgty05B7pf89kl7H7w', 'QQacOXfgNDSwTvJyzB1iLA', 'q50tpzOkywkdHun3X52USg', 'TN1JWAmCgxlE7v-y04fZmg', '9WIvaybongQxohDUttVtzw', 'rkmM0Ku4NmG6gE5DaaEntA', 'FNGhSvqmoGHPvCTcia8RPQ', 'c0JfpOXVBY3ajEhDaCth5A', 'DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg', 'Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw', 'yE1EwlvQ8eTH3MZ6NzFflA', 'vryT2Qf0-ug3yR5UYPt7XQ', '4oMHLqhNZoECVSNU1A8hkQ', 'QOPSnejdvLJ0aOiS89XJcQ', 'jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA', 'c3P8lRnyv_beqsg_efD0ew', '2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 's_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw', 'lAqRELOJTD1Irj8CgWZWBA', '4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ', 'SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og', 'tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA']",2,14,10,22,user,35,33,1,3.48,2,"[2010, 2011, 2012]",Carrie,99,1,135,8,12,512,FALSE,,,11:00,,,,,11:00,FALSE,TRUE,full_bar,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,11:00,FALSE,"['Burgers', 'American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,11:00,Red Robin Gourmet Burgers,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,,,60,,PA,TRUE,23:00,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"175 E Waterfront Drive

This place is all about time of day.  Go in the afternoon during the week for lunch.  Usually the service is good between open and dinner and the food is really made with care from not being rushed.  It's not bad at night but with anyplace, you're taking your chances with so many people.

A burger is $10 but, unlimited fries and drink water (you're about to eat a lot of calories) and two people can have a nice lunch for about $30 with a decent tip.  

If Burgatory has too long of a wait, go here before your movie.  Thank me later.

To be honest, I kind of have a love-hate relationship with Red Robin. It's certainly not my favorite place to eat, particularly during my casual dieting days. Not only are the burgers oversized and/or glazed in some sort of dressing or sauce, all of their appetizers are fried (except for the hummus plate). In short, nothing is waistline friendly unless you're ""that person"" who asks for tons of modifications in their order. I honestly don't think this chain has any interest in developing a lighter option menu, despite these menus' popularity at other restaurants. The only low-calorie item I know of is their skinny margarita, which really doesn't make much of a difference in my calorie intake once the rest of a meal is added in. So that's a big drawback for me.

Still, high calorie content or not, I'm a fan of a good burger, and Red Robin can make a reasonably good burger in my experience. Even when I've just shared a meal or nibbled on an appetizer (yes, the same appetizers I complained about earlier - like I said, it's a love-hate relationship) I've been satisfied with the taste and quality of the food given that the place is a chain restaurant. 

I've especially been impressed with the servers, who really take the time to check on the table whenever I'm there and to keep us posted on the state of our food in the kitchen (which is very appreciated during the dinner rush, a time of day when any customer can feel forgotten and aggravated).

I guess I have to accept what Red Robin for what it is: delicious with a strong dash of dieter's frustration. I'm sure I'll be here again, and, as always, will end up giving in and eating one of their delicious burgers, even if the things are just too much food for little old me.

Simply said, the meat can't stand alone.  Without being slathered in cheese, jalapenos, barbecue sauce, or whatever, the burgers are nothing more than overcooked hockey pucks.

Unfortunately, I suffered a rather embarrassing moment when we were told that the kitchen will not cook a burger rare.  I know better than to ever suggest a corporate restaurant to the PIC again!  

Despite this, we had some decent service and our burgers were pretty good.  After much discussion, we determined that it's not really the burgers that makes Red Robin good, it's the toppings.  Simply said, the meat can't stand alone.  Without being slathered in cheese, jalapenos, barbecue sauce, or whatever, the burgers are nothing more than overcooked hockey pucks.  

Would I eat there again?  It's likely I would go with someone who has less discriminating taste buds.  Would I take PIC?

g8K-AQC2_FKx5soEY0iaZQ,pL-JDFUg0fXmnpnPVst5JQ,"Oh Red Robin, where do I start?

It's not going to be with the long wait time and long line to get in -- no, I went on a Saturday night and that's to be expected at the Waterfront.  

It's not going to be about the bar seating where the tables are crammed so closely together that the guy sitting next to us invited himself into our conversation.  (He was really quite friendly although it was a BIT awkward...)

No, no, no.

I'm going to complain about the poor, slow service, the cold food, and the lack of any type of regret or apology on the part of the restaurant staff.  

We found a seat in the bar section of the restaurant and took a seat.  Our waitress took our drink orders promptly and our drinks came fairly quickly.  That's about where anything positive about the experience ended.

We both ordered burgers, nothing fancy, no special orders.

I am aware that it was busy and that this might have slowed things down a bit, but REALLY?  We waited 45 minutes from the time we ordered until our burgers arrived.  Where in the heck does it take 45 minutes to cook a burger and slap it on a bun?  After about 25 minutes, our waitress came by and asked if we needed anything and told us our food would be out soon.  10 minutes later, all of the tables around us (including TWO tables that were seated after we were) had been served and we still had no food. 

My friend finally went and asked a manager what the holdup was and was told that he would look into it.  Another 10 minutes went by and he brought our food to our table (finally).  No explanation about why it took so long.  No apology.

By the time our food came, we were short on time and practically inhaled our burgers.  The burgers were cool and tasteless -- now maybe we felt they were tasteless because we had to eat so fast that it was like we couldn't even enjoy them...   You would expect that after waiting 45 minutes for a burger and fries that the least they could do is serve it warm...

We didn't end up paying for the burgers, they took them off our check after we complained a second time.  But no one apologized, seemed sorry in the slightest.  I would much rather have paid for my burger and had it arrive warm and promptly...

So.  Red Robin, even in the face of a free burger, you still stink.  I won't be returning.",1,AlvGCHZX0n5puR9eZSZ4lg,1,2,11/20/2011,review,4,,"Oh Red Robin, where do I start?

It's not going to be with the long wait time and long line to get in -- no, I went on a Saturday night and that's to be expected at the Waterfront.  

It's not going to be about the bar seating where the tables are crammed so closely together that the guy sitting next to us invited himself into our conversation.  (He was really quite friendly although it was a BIT awkward...)

No, no, no.

I'm going to complain about the poor, slow service, the cold food, and the lack of any type of regret or apology on the part of the restaurant staff.  

We found a seat in the bar section of the restaurant and took a seat.  Our waitress took our drink orders promptly and our drinks came fairly quickly.  That's about where anything positive about the experience ended.

We both ordered burgers, nothing fancy, no special orders.

The good:

- Endless fries
- It usually is pretty fast. 
- They usually make it up to you if they screw up.

The bad:
- Due to their location they usually attract families with kids screaming at the top of their lungs.

- They used to have problems with running out of french fries and taking forever to make burgers, even though burgers were the only things they made. They have been much better lately though.
- No sliders. Why? Who knows.
- If you order the short stack of onion rings, you get the smaller end. So, you get maybe 2-3 full size onion rings instead of the 6 you should be getting.

It's just that I need a drink! Isn't that server 101? There were so many people standing around tonight (not getting me a drink).
The fries are never ending but the servers don't ask if you want more. This is due to the iPad-esque ordering screen. You'd think with this assistant that they would be able to free up some time.

I've lived in Pittsburgh for 8 years and yesterday was the first time I've ever been to that area... Yet I now want to go!

-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)

-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. 

The food is AWESOME! Worth any little complaints I might think up before it gets there. Once its on the table, I forget them all.

-Fish Sandwiich
-Salmon (huge and delicious)
-Flounder
-Shrimp a few ways (""Norfolk"" style is oily for my taste, and I never had it growing up in Norfolk.)
-Hawkins St Special
-Prime Rib (sized for two, watch it)

The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem., nan",2012-11,2,34,"['UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ']",,,0,,user,,,,3.4,,[],Bennett,10,,16,,1,42,FALSE,,FALSE,10:00,,,,,10:00,FALSE,FALSE,full_bar,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,10:00,FALSE,"['Bars', 'American (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Lounges', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,,Emil's Lounge,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,1,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,20,,PA,TRUE,20:00,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"414 Hawkins Ave

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,uf61rPucuICXhSPXlZ1hIQ,"After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.

Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.

And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.

So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. 

We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'

This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.

Oh...but good food counts too. 

We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!

My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...

The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. 

They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.

Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.

You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.

Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8.

The place is in Rankin - a rough around the edges town in the Mon Valley between Swissvale and Braddock.  Don't be put off at first - the outside doesn't have much decoration to speak of and looks like the sort of place that you might think twice about it.  A TGI Fridays it isn't... And thank god for that.

The place is well-kept but a little dated -  no fripperies here.  But we're not here for the Decor - we're here for some dinner.  

The menu is basic with reasonable prices.  The meats and seafood are high quality and everything is made to order.  Their stuffed cabbage is regarded as the best in  Pittsburgh.  I love stuffed cabbage but I just made a batch a couple of weeks ago and I'm cabbaged out.  Their Ruebens are   also killer (our waitress raved about them).  My wife and I both settled on fish sandwiches.  These are true Pittsburgh fish Sammiches - fresh fried fish in crispy breading, crammed between enormous pillows of soft, yet chewy and crispy Mancini's Italian bread.  No adornments - just a boatload of hot crispy fish.  Emil's uses thick cod fillets piled high rather than a thin fillet that needs to be broken up to fit in the bun.  Truly a great sandwich.  My daughter had the BLT - looked good and on good bread and they weren't skimpy with the bacon.

The service was very pleasant and friendly and the crowd was a great group of folks.  We all had fun with 4 other tables when my wife pulled up a Trivial Pursuit game on her iPhone and pretty much everyone joined in and had a good laugh.

2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ,AedrVIB-PcXbNIutnaMEQw,"Got tickets to the ZoSo concert at Stage AE and decided to switch up my pre-lube location from something other than the Tilted Kilt, River Towne or Bettis Grill. I decided on the Clark Bar.  

I've only been to the Clark Bar once before for lunch about three years ago. I remember being impressed with the Boomer Burger and even tweeted the following about it: ""Just had a Boomer Burger at the Clark Bar for #lunch. Half pound of deliciousness discovered on the N. Shore of #pgh"" (the accompanying pic that I took that day is uploaded here). So I came back to drink a few beers and have some dinner with my lady before the show. 

Speaking of beers, there's a limited selection of craft beers here.  As of this writing, on tap they've got Penn Marzen, Dogfish Head 60 min and Sam Adams Cold Snap.  In bottles there's Bells Two Hearted IPA and Sierra Nevada Pale Ale (they also listed Blue Moon and IC Light as craft beers but I'm sorry, I don't think so).

I walked in the door at around 5:30 and I noticed that it wasn't too crowded; possibly due to the weather.  There were four guys at the bar and a couple of tables were occupied but nothing like I've experienced at the establishments on the other side of the parking lot.

While waiting for my date to join me, I started with a Sam Adam's Cold Snap as a tribute to the day's February, single digit, temps before moving on to the Marzen. Both were decent beers, very drinkable, but nothing all that special.

It was pushing close to 7:00 when we decided to order dinner. By that time we were the only people left in the bar.  We asked the bartender about the crowd they get and if this is normal for a Friday night.  He said that lunchtime is normally their busiest time and he gets a few regulars that work in the building after 5:00 for a bite and a few drinks. Other than those times, it's before and after the ball games that draws the most business (as you would expect).

The menu is pretty simple offering a few appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches and the ""House Specialty"" Fish and Chips.  There were also specials listed on a chalk board at the entrance announcing drink specials, wings and a Cajun burger.  I decided I would go Cajun tonight. My girlfriend settled on a turkey burger. 

My Cajun burger was spicy good delicious; perfectly grilled with a slice of pepper jack cheese and hot pepper rings balanced with a tomato slice and lettuce. I also got a sample slice of my lady's turkey burger (yeah, we do that) and it was juicy goodness as well topped with cheddar cheese, onion, lettuce and tomato. Her burger came with slaw and mine with fries.

Overall this is a casual, easy bar.  They obviously recognize their Pittsburgh roots and being nestled between the two stadiums they cater to the Pittsburgh sports fan.  Photos of past local sports teams and legends adorn the walls in a relatively tasteful manner. But what's really cool is all of the autographed baseballs, bats and footballs in the hallway behind the bar.

I'd recommend this place to any out-of-towner or anyone going to see a ball game or show on the North Shore. I give it a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service and delicious burgers.

In theory it sounds good. In real life I'll just drown any morsel of food I can into the chocolate and stuff it in! 

This is a special occasion restaurant. A special occasion where I have enough money to spare, because dear lord, it's pricey! 

The two greatest tips that they don't advertise: 

*Half off on Sundays from noon-3 PM. REMEMBER TO MENTION THIS TO YOUR SERVER! I learned that fact today when I got the shock of a full priced bill. I assumed they just took the discount off automatically, but apparently you have to tell your server as soon as you sit down that you want the half price meal. 

All Big Night Out meals half price = awesome deal! 

*Every day after 9 PM you can get cheese and chocolate fondue and a bottle of wine for $35. Serves two. 

The Big Night Out consists of your choice of cheese fondue (lots o' different choices of cheeses), salads (get the mushroom one), main dish (usually includes seafood and/or meat), veggies, potatoes and ravioli) and chocolate fondue (mmmmmm!!). 

You pick the type of broth for your main course. Usually there's one that complements meat and one for seafood. You're also able to mix and match your chocolate ingredients or choose one from the menu. I lurrrve the S'More's chocolate, it includes choco, marshmallow and graham cracker bits. And, ohhhhhh, the things you dip in the chocolate. Cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice crispies, marshmallows, banana's and strawberries. Seriously orgasmic!! 

They usually switch up the menu often so you can come once every couple of months and find something new. I also love the atmosphere. It's a great date night place or good for a group outing. The nice thing is that if you go with a group, you can choose a bunch of different cheeses, broths and chocolate to sneak a taste of all of them. 

Good thing for me that it is pricey. IF it was cheap, I don't think I'd like what the scale had to say after monthly visits to this place!",0,YssP-_6iP0SLBsqUQGs6rQ,1,5,4/3/2011,review,4,Half off Sunday's from noon to 3!,"If I could pour the whole pot of fondue into my mouth I would. Fo real.

r_96n9O0jNzbNCZDkSB0EQ,JfURqcQhHa135Jd20RTyMg,"My husband and I went to the Melting Pot on a whim last night.  Despite the fact that we didn't have a reservation, we were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu.  I had the Fondue Delight and my husband had the Fondue Fusion.  Both were really, really good with the coq au vin cooking bouillon.  For our cheese course, we chose the Traditional Swiss Cheese fondue and that came with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and a nice helping of bread cubes.  My only complaint is that there was a heavy alcohol taste to the cheese sauce... it might have benefited from being cooked a bit longer to remove some of the alcoholic taste.  But, it was very good.  We chose the spinach mushroom salads for our second course.  The mushrooms and spinach were very fresh and quite tasty with the shallot vinaigrette that it came with.  The main courses were excellent but the bartender's estimation of cooking times were not very accurate and led to undercooked food.  Fortunately, I am a cook, so we were able to gauge when stuff was appropriately cooked.  The bartender told us that the potatoes should take about 10 minutes... they took 30.  The chicken, about 3 minutes.  It was about 5.  The shrimp and lobster, he said 1 minute.  I cooked them for about 2-3 minutes.  So, you need to be familiar with what undercooked feels like - rather than looks like (because the place is very dim).  We chose the bananas foster for our dessert course along with some 10 year old port.  The bartender told us that he was out of the 10 year old port, but was kind enough to up-sell us to the 20 for an extra dollar.  It was well worth it!  The dessert course was phenomenal!  It came with bananas, strawberries, rice krispie treats, cheesecake, red velvet cake cubes, chocolate cake cubes, and various flavors of marshmallows.  Overall, while it was an expensive meal, we left feeling good and happy for the experience.

The food wasn't insanely unique, in and of itself, but the experience of cooking your food for yourself over the pots and the fondue and desert creations were cool.

We went there with a large group of friends and had a private room.
Our menu and our mutual criticisms:

There are 4 courses to the meals.
A Cheese Fondue appetizer that is served with raw veggies and different breads for dipping.
A ""salad"" (we chose the lettuce wraps which were really tastey with a really great sauce).
The entree of the meats that you choose and cooking broth that you choose to cook them in.  You spear a piece of meat on your fondue fork and let it simmer in the boiling broth and they tell you about how long to submerge/cook each type of meat.
Your desert (several different types of chocolate fondue to choose from) and this is served with Marshmallows, Rice Crispy Treats, Cheesecake, brownies and strawberries.


""Big Night Out"" Option 2 of ""Fondue Fusion""
Spinach/Artichoke Fondue = AWESOME, best fondue on the table!
Lobster, Steak, Pork, Ahi Tuna, Chicken, Shrimp & Veggie Wontons = Awesome!
Mojo Style cooking sauce = good (we'd try something different next time)
Dessert Fondue (we chose the crunchy peanut butter chocolate) and it was amazing!!!

Cool for a large group or a romantic night out.

qZbgGiWIi52GL7o3ot5ckw,7EjO_0RBSd2mEwo6Og8zbQ,"I've been to the Melting Pot multiple times over the last few years, and I've never been disappointed. However, I was slightly disappointed last night because I had made reservations, but they gave our table away because my friend was stuck in traffic and was 10 minutes late. They refused to seat me until my friend arrived, so we had to wait an additional 10 minutes after her arrival to be seated. Why bother making a reservation?

But this is a trivial matter compared to the overall experience. I usually don't order an entree unless I'm bringing someone who's never been there before. I'm more than happy with just cheese, chocolate, and drinks (and this cuts the cost down considerably). But we decided to go all out and order all 3 courses. We started with the Fiesta cheese, which is my favorite. There is salsa in the cheese, and jalapenos are added to your liking. Dippers include bread, tortilla chips, apples, broccoli, and carrots. Next, we both ordered the individial filet mignon meal. We chose Coq au Vin for the cooking style, which has a red wine base. I was a little worried that it would have too much of a wine taste, but it didn't at all. It also comes with mushrooms and some other things for flavoring (celery, I'm guessing). Entrees also come with potatoes (put them in early - they take forever to cook), broccoli, and more mushrooms. The filet meal also comes with 5 dipping sauces. My favorite is the spinach dip-like sauce, and the teriyaki is good as well. We went with the Flaming Turtle for dessert. Ours didn't seem to have any caramel in it, but it was delicious nonetheless. Dippers included Rice Krispie Treats (my favorite), brownie bites, blondie bites, marshmallows, angel food cake, pineapple, strawberries, and bananas. All of it was delicious and we left feeling like we'd never eat again.

Service is always excellent at the Melting Pot. Our server, Dalles, was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. It was a busy Saturday night and she stayed on top of things.

I noticed that some reviewers don't like the location of the restaurant. I guess it is a little odd, being located inside Station Square mall. But I've never even noticed that there aren't any windows, and I've always just considered the dim lighting part of the ambiance.

The cost is rather high (our bill was over $100 for two people), but the Melting Pot offers specials such as Ladies' Night, 80s Night (with 80s prices), and Late Night Fondue after 9pm. They send out an email about once a month to let you know what's happening that month.

Overall, it was another great experience, and I'll be back many times to come!",0,YssP-_6iP0SLBsqUQGs6rQ,0,5,8/10/2014,review,0,,"I've been to the Melting Pot multiple times over the last few years, and I've never been disappointed. However, I was slightly disappointed last night because I had made reservations, but they gave our table away because my friend was stuck in traffic and was 10 minutes late. They refused to seat me until my friend arrived, so we had to wait an additional 10 minutes after her arrival to be seated. Why bother making a reservation?

But this is a trivial matter compared to the overall experience. I usually don't order an entree unless I'm bringing someone who's never been there before. I'm more than happy with just cheese, chocolate, and drinks (and this cuts the cost down considerably). But we decided to go all out and order all 3 courses. We started with the Fiesta cheese, which is my favorite. There is salsa in the cheese, and jalapenos are added to your liking. Dippers include bread, tortilla chips, apples, broccoli, and carrots. Next, we both ordered the individial filet mignon meal. We chose Coq au Vin for the cooking style, which has a red wine base. I was a little worried that it would have too much of a wine taste, but it didn't at all. It also comes with mushrooms and some other things for flavoring (celery, I'm guessing). Entrees also come with potatoes (put them in early - they take forever to cook), broccoli, and more mushrooms. The filet meal also comes with 5 dipping sauces. My favorite is the spinach dip-like sauce, and the teriyaki is good as well. We went with the Flaming Turtle for dessert. Ours didn't seem to have any caramel in it, but it was delicious nonetheless. Dippers included Rice Krispie Treats (my favorite), brownie bites, blondie bites, marshmallows, angel food cake, pineapple, strawberries, and bananas. All of it was delicious and we left feeling like we'd never eat again.

gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA,MXfRgc-a0ENqK2msHNlzdg,"In a nutshell, it's a pricey, fun fondue experience at this well-done chain restaurant best saved for a special dress-up occasion in which you've got at least 2.5 hours to spare and you'd really like to use that time to get to know your dinner date better.

They have many options for the number of course you have (one to four) and the components in those options.

We opted for the full four course meal starting with spinach and artichoke cheese fondue, house salads with peppercorn ranch dressing, entrees of Pacific Rim and Surf and Turf with a coq au vin broth for dipping, and finally, the chocolate turtle dessert fondue.  The cheese course came with bread, apples, and veggies for dipping; the main entrees we shared included duck, shrimp, filet mignon, mushroom pockets, and lobster with 8 different dipping sauces (4 per course).  It also included potatoes and veggies.  The chocolate course was a mixture of milk chocolate and caramel and nuts with so many delicious items to dip -- bananas, pineapple, rice crispy treats, marshmallows, brownies.  

I had thought it would be too much food to consume, but you'd be surprised how you just keep dipping and munching over the 2.5 hours it takes for all four courses.  It takes so long because first, you peruse the menu for several moments, order some wine perhaps, then it takes awhile for the pot set between you on your tabletop to heat up.  Once it does, the server comes back and prepares the cheese fondue from scratch, adding each ingredient and stirring until smooth and delectable.  You spend quite some time with your partner in food crime savoring the tidbits covered in gooey cheese before heading to the next course -- your salads.  A salad is a salad and may be just a distraction while they're cutting up and preparing your proteins and dips you chose.  Again, they set a pot in front of you of the broth you selected and you wait a bit for it to heat up and you're off and eating again, this time sharing the delights with your partner after the instructed amount of time for cooking them.  When all this is said and done, the chocolate course comes out and, again, it's a pot of chocolate and other decadent sins which your server prepares.  Finally, you and your partner settle in to dip, swirl anything and everything into the mixture while all the while uttering sounds of contentment.  

Do you have to dress-up?  No, but when the meal takes 2.5 hours and the bill comes to 130.00 for a four course meal and some alcoholic beverages before tip and it was for a special occasion -- my husband's birthday in our case -- then, by all means I think it deserves a bit of gussying up.",1,YssP-_6iP0SLBsqUQGs6rQ,0,5,11/2/2015,review,3,,"In a nutshell, it's a pricey, fun fondue experience at this well-done chain restaurant best saved for a special dress-up occasion in which you've got at least 2.5 hours to spare and you'd really like to use that time to get to know your dinner date better.

11Ydte1VfE85UHK24d4QRQ,OczvulWpHe9ark1vJH3huw,"Melting Pot is a great place for a special occasion or a romantic date.  It is on the pricey side, especially for food you basically prepare yourself, but the experience you have along with an excellent quality of service make it worth the occasional splurge.

My fiance and I went to Melting Pot moments after we got engaged.  When he made reservations he told them it was to celebrate our engagement and when we arrived, they had a private booth in the back along with a small grouping of carnations.  You can order roses or other flower arrangements but because we were going to the Pirates game later that evening, he didn't since he figured they would just die.  While the carnations were nothing spectacular, it was a nice touch that they didn't  have to do for us especially since he had not ordered flowers.

Service was fantastic and they were good about being attentive without being overbearing and intrusive.

We ordered the big night out with the lobster option.  All of the meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful.  Our request for extra dipping sauces and more mushrooms were met with a smile and promptly delivered.  We even joked around about getting extra pine nuts on our salads and the server brought out an entire bowl for us!

Even though we ordered a bottle of champagne to drink with our meal, our server surprised us with more champagne with heart shaped strawberries to have with our dessert course fondue.

We had a great time, left stuffed and really enjoyed having our first meal together as an engaged couple at the Melting Pot.  I have no doubt we will be back.",0,YssP-_6iP0SLBsqUQGs6rQ,0,4,6/28/2012,review,2,,"Melting Pot is a great place for a special occasion or a romantic date.

sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg,zegqe-dtyhzsXLE__vcW5Q,"The Melting Pot is one of those places that you visit about once a year - the prices put it out of reach for a regular night out. We went for our anniversary and ordered the ""Big Night Out"" along with the wine sampler. The food was very good - a four course 2 hour meal. The starter was a cheese dip. I'm not a fan of dipping apples in cheese and can't understand why they aren't part of dessert, but the bread was excellent. We ventured outside of our comfort zone and tried the lobster as part of our main meal. Although I don't typically enjoy seafood, I'm glad that we ordered it. I'm not a big fan of having to cook your own meal. I found that the need to time everything was generally a distraction that took away from the experience rather than added to it. The real treat here is the dessert. We took our server's recommendation and ordered the s'mores dipper. It may be one of the most succulent after-dinner experiences ever. 

The one drawback here was the service. There were some positives: they gave my wife a flower and card for the special date, we were seated promptly at our reserved time, and we got a good table tucked away in the back corner. On the other hand, for $60/plate the service should be 110% on point, but it just wasn't. Our waitress was new (by her own admission) and unfortunately it showed. She forgot to bring our wine out with the meal, and her timing was off with checking in on us, which meant we had to ask another of the wait staff to remind her that we didn't have it. The water-bringer-outer (I believe that to be the technical term) was not very prompt either. We often had empty water glasses, and when he did show up he didn't have enough water to fill both glasses. We had requested a take-out box for the remainder of our dessert but never received it (we took it anyway). There was also the awkward moment where we overheard the table next to us mention that their waitress had given them their dessert for free.

wNtyBJa_qaRYUew_TWplgw,JrJ-pNGHTKcifJnnq8tDJQ,"Pros:
- Cheese fondue is excellent.  Chocolate fondue is excellent.  Who doesn't love dipping things in cheese or chocolate?  The Melting Pot gives you bread, veggies, and apples for the cheese, and a whole tray of delicious goodies for the chocolate - cheesecake, brownies, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows.  There are also multiple kinds of cheese and chocolate fondues.
- Service is really good.  If it's a special occasion, you can order flowers to be waiting at the table.  Because it was our five-year anniversary, our waitress brought us just enough champagne to do a toast, at no charge.  They tucked us away in a private little booth, but we weren't forgotten.

The cons:
- I'm surprised no one mentioned this, but I thought the entree was really bland.  You heat up your entree in broth, which doesn't add much flavor.  It's basically diet food.  Even the wide array of yummy sauces couldn't save the vegetarian entree.  My boyfriend ordered chicken, chorizo, shrimp and something else, and his came with spices already on the meats, so it was slightly better than mine.

The consensus was that it would be a lot faster and a lot cheaper to come and just get cheese & chocolate fondues, and maybe a drink.  I definitely look forward to doing that again sometime soon.",0,YssP-_6iP0SLBsqUQGs6rQ,0,3,4/18/2009,review,4,,"Pros:

We were seating promptly for our 7:00 pm reservation. We got a romantic little corner booth. They have some interesting ""speciality"" drinks. I got a pomegranate Cosmo which was really good, BJ got his usual beer. We were kinda familiar with the menu, but needed our server's help with selecting our fondues. We ordered off the ""Alpine Big Night Out"" special menu. Sure, the restaurant is a bit pricey, but we got a lot to eat. Our first course included different types of bread, veggies and apples for dipping. We each got a very delicious salad, BJ's included Gruyere and fontina cheeses, hard-boiled eggs & honey roasted almonds with a yummy shallot vinaigrette. I got a California salad, with mixed baby greens, Roma tomatoes, walnuts, Gorgonzola and raspberry black walnut vinaigrette. Their salads were so, so good! At this point we were pretty much full! 

Then came our main course. We got a lobster tail, NY strip, bratwurst, filet mignon, marinated shrimp, chicken, ravioli's and veggies. I'm not sure what type of cooking broth we got, but your server can tell you what goes best with what you are ordering. It was really a lot of fun cooking our little bites and my boyfriend took charge of cooking all our vegetables. I was kinda put off at first of the thought of steak being cooked in broth. I like my meat seared a bit. But believe me, it was delicious. We also enjoyed the different sauces. 

We could not pass on dessert, we got the Flaming Turtle, which was milk chocolate and chopped pecans ""flamb??ed"" at our table. We got strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispies treats, pound cake and brownies. Lot's of fun!! 

Also, thanks to yelper Angel for the heads up about their ""mailing list"". We visited their website and got a coupon that saved us $16 on our dinner, which was very nice.

-0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA,2GFBNUJ3Khf5i8RXw0sdfA,"The Melting Pot is great for occasions--birthdays, anniversaries, b'nai mitzvos, graduation, you name it. When it comes to the food and service, this place excels. I can only applaud the high quality raw food combined with a gourmet fondue experience (I had no idea fondue was more than just melted cheese) and a dedicated and attentive staff that made sure we had the night we were paying for.

Why the three stars then? Location.

The building itself is within the inside mall of Station Square, resulting in a severe lack of windows. The intimate structure of the franchise results in nearly every table somehow being in a corner, and combined with the lack of windows and dim lighting, I felt like I was in a fondue dungeon.

When it comes to the food and service, this place excels. I can only applaud the high quality raw food combined with a gourmet fondue experience (I had no idea fondue was more than just melted cheese) and a dedicated and attentive staff that made sure we had the night we were paying for.

Why the three stars then? Location.

The building itself is within the inside mall of Station Square, resulting in a severe lack of windows. The intimate structure of the franchise results in nearly every table somehow being in a corner, and combined with the lack of windows and dim lighting, I felt like I was in a fondue dungeon.

Start with dessert first. Not literally, I mean, it's up to you. This is my favorite part and I am drooling just thinking about it right now. The chocolate fondue in several variations, paired with fresh fruit, cake, and more (it's to DIE for). Well, maybe not DIE, I tend to exaggerate when it comes to things I love. But I'm a big chocolate enthusiast, so of course, this is something I look forward to every time I visit The Melting Pot. The servers are very casual and usually quite knowledgeable, and don't really force you into settling for a payment plan if all you want is an appetizer. I only say payment plan because a meal for two is actually quite expensive, especially if you go all out and get wine, drinks, etc. The appetizer fondue is amazing as well. With the cheese or chocolate fondue, you pick any combination you like of what they have to offer, the choices are basically unlimited. The appetizers come with vegetables and an array of fresh bread bits. The ambiance is really nice, generally quiet, romantic, lights dimmed way down low. I have good memories of this place, and it's in a nice location of Pittsburgh in Station Square looking over the river. The sad thing is, you really wouldn't want to take your date out to any of the clubs next door afterwards, unless you wanted her to get groped in a corner on her way out of the bathroom or trashed talked to by some fugly wigger or wiggette.

I am no cheap skate when it comes to food, I LOVE spending money on food. But I feel it is a little ridiculous to pay $43 a person to cook your own food, when you know, your total meal cost rough $11.

You definitely pay for the experience, but it was worth it. We ordered the ""fondue by you"" (or something along those lines) where we each picked three entree options along with the four course meal. We went with the normal cheddar cheese fondue (it was fabulous!). We both got the house salads, very good as well. For our entrees we got the teriyaki steak, filet, buffalo shrimp, and chicken potstickers. The meat takes a LONG time too cook, so just watch for that.We went with the normal vegetable broth cooking option. The sauces were all delicious as well. For dessert, we got the turtle chocolate, and it was fabulous! 

Our server was wonderful as well, offering to bring us more veggies or dippers for each course. 

It was about $100 total, which really wasn't bad given the experience. I highly recommend for a date night!


UPDATE:
My boyfriend and I went again last week to celebrate the end of my semester. This time we tried the cheese option with pesto, I can't remember exactly what it was called but this was by far the best. I highly recommend this cheese over the other options!! Also we tried the oil and batter option for our entrees and I think we both preferred this to the plain broth. It is a lot and you have to be careful but it really was delicious!

Staff was very friendly and patient to explain the menu to us. We basically all opted for the 4-course experience, which includes cheese fondue, a salad, entree fondue, and dessert fondue. Our waiter, Tim, helped us walk through the options and gave us some recommendations on which fondues were the most popular. He was also efficient on mixing the fondues and explaining what each ingredient was while he was making them at the table.

All the food was tasty and fresh. The bread was soft, the vegetables were nice and firm, the meats were well-seasoned and tender, and the fruit/desserts were fresh as well. The cheese fondues had great flavor and depth (honestly, I could probably just do a meal of cheese fondues), the salad was just enough, the coq au vin and bourguignon fondues had good savory flavor, and the chocolates were sweet without being overly so.

Be prepared to spend an while, as each course takes a bit to prepare. The entree course takes time, as you are also cooking your own food at the table.

Atmosphere:  Quaint and elegant.  Well chosen  music in the background.  Great place for a romantic evening or a fun party out.

Service: From the bar manger Hank to the hostess and our fabulous server - honestly - they could not have done a better job.  Our server was knowledgeable  - pleasant and attentive. You could tell she came to her restaurant on her off time.  She was insightful and helpful.  She was there when you wanted her to be but was in no way overbearing.  She was an absolute delight.

Food: Very fresh and plenty of it.  We chose the Big Night Out.  Picked what worked out for us - were able to substitute anything we did not like. Great selection - fresh and plentiful.  Everything you could want.

Wine:  As it was a special occasion  - I brought my own bottle. Corkage fee was more than reasonable.  Being the curious type I also read the wine list.  The list was complete and well balanced.  Anybody - novice to expert - on a budget or not - could absolutely find a great bottle of wine.  This is a great list and one I will be ordering from in the future.

Allergy:  My girlfriend has a severe life threatening nut allergy.  When our server came to the table she was already aware of it.  She explained all the food options and what needed to be avoided.  She also stressed any actions she took to assure there was no nut contact.  I have witnessed many restaurants deal with this allergy and they were by the far the best.

I rarely if ever post these types of reviews - but our experience was so good I felt guilty not sharing our excellent experience.

Yo54Xi3ZELF-dQ27xomeug,MhFVvdZ4gTo4AwLgF-vxQQ,"Came here with a small group this past weekend to celebrate my cousin's birthday. It was my first time at the Melting Pot or any type of fondue place, and honestly, it was a little overwhelming. Understanding the different menus and options, what things you pick to dip, what things you pick to dip in, what goes with what... Our waitress was definitely willing to answer any of our questions though.

For cheese we had the Spinach Artichoke and Wisconsin Trio, which were both pretty good. We got the Bouillon and Mojo for cooking our entrees, and I got the Shrimp and Sirloin to go with it. Honestly, the time spent deliberating over which cooking styles to go with wasn't worth it, because I don't think the flavors were strong enough (or at least don't seep into your food enough for sitting in it a couple minutes) to really make a big difference. Perhaps I'm a little impatient, but it would be nice to maybe have some more than 2 fondue utensils, so I can cook more than a couple slivers of meat at once.

For dessert we got Pure milk chocolate and I believe the Flaming Turtle (whatever the second one was, I didn't have any because it had nuts). All of the desserts to dip in the chocolate were delicious!

Overall, everything was pretty good. My cousin loved the experience and so it was a great night, but I don't think I would personally ever pick it for myself. I can't really justify the price for what you're getting, and I prefer food I don't have to cook myself, 1 piece at a time =)",0,YssP-_6iP0SLBsqUQGs6rQ,0,4,11/27/2012,review,1,,"Came here with a small group this past weekend to celebrate my cousin's birthday.

FVgun7N5mH5zBn3546aLvA,sBJI2xVrz8hQAwnomItnew,"Got the ""Big Night Out"" couples special. Worth every penny. Was nice we could substitute the cheese fondue, salad and dessert for what we wanted. Was highly satisfied with the entree choice. The ""three rivers feast entree came with: teriyaki steak, filet mignon, chicken breast, 4 shrimp, bbq seasoned pork, and pot stickers. We also added a lobster tail.  

Started with the fiesta cheese fondue which was excellent. Beer base, cheddar cheese and salsa. The waitress allowed us to choose how spicy we wanted the cheese by adding fresh jalape??os which was nice. We went for hot which was perfect level of spicy. This was served with a white bread, pumpernickel, tortilla chips, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, and Granny Smith Apples (not a good combo personally). 

Caesar salad was next. Pretty standard. Small but that was ok because I didn't want to get too full.


Next was the entree. The meats were served with mushrooms, redskin potatoes and broccoli. We cooked it Coq Au Vin style 
(burgundy wine infused with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.) The pork was my favorite and hers was the seafood. It was also served with 6 small dipping sauces (+1 for lobster) which paired greatly with all the meats and vegetables. 


Lastly, grand finale! White chocolate Creme br??l??e. Went all out and got the additional dippers. Fresh strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bananas, chocolate chip cookie, brownie, pound cake, gram cracker coated marshmallows, Oreo coated marshmallows, slice of cheesecake, cream puffs, Rice Krispie treats, and some rolled cookie. 

Staff was great. They clear your table fast so no dirty plates sit around. If you ever need more specific dippers they'll bring them for you. Very accommodating. Didn't like the first beer I got so the waitress didn't charge me for it and got me a different one even though I didn't care.

Other classic rides never get old: Kangaroo, Paratrooper, Merry Go Round, Pirate Ship.

Yeah, this isn't Cedar Point or Disney World, but it's still fantastic.  Obviously, I've got a lot of nostalgia from growing up here and going every year for the ""school picnic"" in May, but this is a fun time for anyone.  If you're not from the Burgh, but you've ever watched one of those Top 10 Rollercoaster shows on Discovery Channel, chances are you've seen Kennywood.  Also, the movie ""Adventureland"" with Michael Cera was filmed here.

The highlights:

1. The fries at the Potato Patch - Great any way you like them!
2. The Thunderbolt, Jackrabbit, and Racer - old school wooden roller coasters FTW!
3. Noah's Ark - If you can't hear that whistle when I say Kennywood Noah's Ark, then you didn't grow up in Pittsburgh!
4. The landscaping
5. People watching (esp. if you enjoy fashion faux pas!)

Someone mentioned the ""Garfieldization"" of the Old Mill.  It's definitely not cool.  Kennywood was recently sold to a parent company (from out of the USA; maybe Mexico) and I hope that doesn't mean there's going to be a lot of changes made to the traditional park feel.  Kennywood isn't a Six Flags or Paramount Park, and that's what makes it great.  If it tries to be too much like those, it will really fade away.",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,5,3/16/2010,review,1,,"Classic rollercoaster heaven!

nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ,tOqNcmDyp6EU8b-LiMcbjQ,"True Story:  I went to Kennywood, got Potato Patch fries and left.  No lie! 

I would have never done this if it wasn't for a couple factors.  One the fact that I had free tickets (hello, I'm cheap!) and Two being that it was CRAZY busy!  Like I had never seen it this busy ever!  I guess it was High School Band Night.  Please, for the love of God, find out when it is every year and NEVER go then!  It was swarming with smelly teens! 

So obviously Potato Patch fries can justify a long trip here! 

Seriously though, it's really worth the trip and usually total traffic hassle (seriously, at least one bridge over to the park is closed every year!) to come here once or maybe twice a year!  I love the old amusement park feel.  You definitely don't get that from Cedar Point or a Six Flags. 

The good things to take away from those major parks is the major rides.  Kennywood has that in the Phantom's Revenge!  I LOVE me some roller coasters and this one is at the top of my list!  This is major, so listen up!  You go slooooowly up the first hill and whip down the first hill and up to the second one and you shoot down the second hill into a ravine and it's a MEGA drop.  It's so so so much fun! 

They also have a couple wooden roller coasters, my fav being the Thunderbolt.  It's one of those classic ones that just jumps and whips you all around.  Really, any ride that flings me around I'm into!  Which brings me to my favorite spinny, make you maybe want to throw up in a good way ride....the Aero 360!!  It swings you around 360 degrees (dah) and holds you suspended upside down for a couple seconds, every couple swings.  It's fantastic, but not for the weak stomachs out there! 

I have to admit, I do have to go back and try the new Sky Coaster. Every time I tried to ride it the line was LOOOOONG.  I'm sorta impatient, especially when it's sweltering out, so that one was skipped last year.  Hopefully since the hype is over it will be a shorter wait, or I'll just suffer for the thrill this time! 

So, potato fries gooood, rollar coaster real good!  Just don't do them at the same time.  NOT GOOD!  Have fun!!",1,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,8,4,4/27/2011,review,1,,"True Story:  I went to Kennywood, got Potato Patch fries and left.  No lie!

9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ,3FWTIZkGvckSmCTlXsvukQ,"Kennywood park has been a longstanding Pittsburgh tradition of amusement parks. School picnics are held here. Special events including the yearly fall fantasy of bands and parades also are a big draw.

Kennywood park is one of the few remaining amusement parks that offer not only tiered admission but also a ""nightrider"" pass of $26.99 if arriving after 5:00. Discount tickets coupons are also available at local Giant Eagle stores for weekday admission. Senior citizen rates start at age 55.

Kennywood still has picnic tables which has been a longstanding tradition of families bringing food into the park for an event or family gathering.

You are no longer issued wristbands upon entering once you pass the security checkpoint.  Rides are clearly indicated with restrictions and a bar is used to certify height requirements for children.

Kennywood still has their famous iconic rides and eateries, of the latter, the potato patch is the most popular. The train ride has been revamped to give you a pictorial history of the park. The Merry Go Round is the center of its classic elegance and the famous meeting place for friends. Noah's Ark still remains as their trademark walk through dark ride and the famous Thunderbolt, once known as the ""king of the coasters"" provides a thrill seeking ride for those who love wooden coasters. Also among ""hidden"" icons is the famous ""Old Mill"" boat ride which has been remodeled to Garfield's nightmare.

Kennywood offers something for everyone in your family. For thrill seekers, coasters such as ""the Phantom's revenge"" along with Racer and Jack Rabbit offer fun and excitement. There are other thrill rides my personal favorite being the Black widow which is a pendulum style ride where about 50 people sit in a rotating circle as it sways back and forth to extremely high levels!

Kennywood does offer a VIP pass if you wish to purchase it to avoid the lines for coasters only. During weekdays the lines for these rides are not as bad so you can plan your day accordingly.

They have an area called ""Lost Kennywood"" to reflect an era from our grandparent's generation. The park was founded in 1898. Kiddieland is available to small children wanting to ride a miniature version of some of the big named rides. You can see some of it from the train ride.

Water rides like the ""Pittsburgh plunge"" cool you off on an excessive hot day but I see they have now installed pay for drying stations if you don't want to walk around totally soaked.

They are in the process of opening a 4D theater within the week called ""the Ice age"".  All I could see was that it does require 3D glasses.

Food, ice cream, and treats are everywhere. There are two indoor restaurants-the Parkside cafeteria and Johnny Rockets (will be reviewed separately). Handicapped access is also available at most of the rides as well as lockers. Please note you can ""stow"" your gear before boarding certain rides but you do so at your own risk..

They also have daily shows along with plenty of park benches to rest. If you look around you can find more of Kennywood's history such as the historic windmill. Landmark signs point them out. More information about the park can be found on their website.

Finally they will offer rain checks in the event of inclement weather under certain guidelines. Kennywood is a timeless tradition for Pittsburgh and I hope to visit again.",2,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,1,4,7/28/2015,review,2,,"Kennywood park has been a longstanding Pittsburgh tradition of amusement parks.

Kennywood is a timeless tradition for Pittsburgh and I hope to visit again., nan",2013-02,65,330,"['Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg', 'AGOmxrO-YUnltljd0SI08g', 'M-O0tasOl0SGiUsxdO5cZw', 'FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A', 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw', 'sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg', 'og1G5WbU6yT-MY_BRILKFA', 'oc4Ne7SJo4WGdzbm6jtCXg', 'qWtBYHSW9heJXXRTqkaZRg', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', '4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA', 'GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', '2H-ibWQ3ok_LlUeb4SPiLw', 'J6-9Y2ZpPUjcoN2EH9aYlA', 'l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg', 'F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA', '2UC3rwRm6swuNFt_GhKOhw', 'Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w', '6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg', 'ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ', 'mzG1ixWgZmgi8dcLARGlEw', 'iyNf5jr-34Bg6nKOGEZXKg', 'r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ', 'J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA', '6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA', 'bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew', 'mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w', 's0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q', 'kWkgwRxqWD-h260dMTkHUA', 'suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q', 'e1W6pOaJbovM-jEosgwOCw', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', '9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg', 'csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ', '0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA', 'JsKvjx4Qiwvof8RV3luTrw', 'lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ', '3_eHstHxLLwqarRifM_6PQ', 'f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA', 'wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ', 'E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA', 'DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg', 'Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw', 'WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg', 'DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA', 'Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q', 'bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw', 'lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg', '2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg', 'KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw', 'eR-Ay92e9ZAy4J3UfZvb3Q', 'H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 'RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw', 'XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA', '3klCtdbZ6NqaaqXXbcmBRg', 'Pe6o1SR3T98ONB_SXaHd6Q', 'jaQtFNFb6iX5kOVvmcu7Pg', 'tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ', 'hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw', 'v3Zkgv-Re0aUYfmBAPa2ng', 'GC9ARGIiuJqUJSmVSMzA6w', 'UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA', '4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ', 'Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', 'tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g', 'adazKj0m2qJWEryQ2wbSCA', 'V3AKvUyVLlS1Bj1Qr4CN9g', 'y9Q2mHM8av_2fiqvvers-Q', 'VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ', '2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ', 'L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ', 'yWSSnsbTeusmrASKB6h6Dg', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA', '0o7RNtR1IPmS-Z4crt8l5Q', 'X8JLvSlgfsnhfzb_lOzgbg', 'es9l0E8GJT4eWyCTSU4C2A', 'rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA']",1,22,9,7,user,13,19,1,3.57,,"[2014, 2015]",Arlene,428,,135,20,1,580,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Active Life', 'Amusement Parks']",,,Kennywood,,,,,,,,,,,,,123,,PA,,,,,,"4800 Kennywood Blvd

WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg,qXS7FCukdwuBB-VG5Z2EFQ,"Am I the only one who gets excited for 2 weeks prior to Kennywood?! :) Bobby & I went on Sunday and had a blast! The weather was chilly at first, yet clear skies, and then warmed up just enough for 'perfect Kennywood weather'. 

Of course we enjoy the coasters, but it's the little rides that remind you of your childhood -- like the bumper cars, musik express, pirate ship, swings, ect that really gives this park history and the family-like feel.

But on to the coasters! I've always had a blast no matter how long the wait may be. The new(er) Sky Rocket - the roller coaster - is awesome! Even though it's short lived, the thrill you get is insane! Also, for some reason I ALWAYS make sure to ride the Racers first. I think it's because the line goes quicker so it's a good way to start the day, haha. 

Even my boyfriend who is terrified of roller coaster rode the Sky Rocket & Phantom's Revenge (proud moment because he literally had a panic attack on the hill of the revenge 2 years in a row & the 1st year he was asking me if the Thunderbolt was scary-- a wooden flipping coaster!)

Another plus (or maybe a negative in some eyes) is that they sell beer. It's across from the Aero 360 behind a wooden, white picket fence and security checks your ID before you even go in.  It's $7 for a draft, wayyy too much in my opinion but it might be a good idea one day.

You can't forget about the food! Potato Patch fries with cheese & bacon are a must but there is also hot sausage, corn dogs, 2 cafe's, a mexican place with tacos/nachos that i didnt see till after i ate :( it must be new.. 

All in all, Kennywood is a great day for the family. We are lucky to have an awesome amusement park in Pittsburgh.

I go to Kennywood a couple times a year and I think most others agree with me that it is simple the standard for what a  park should be., nan",2009-06,12,188,"['5eQp8QFHTwSrkW-_VtCQJA', '5yC_sdGnYfXTX7Djp_4SVQ', '57kmdBfFM28OQtJInGciPA', '7xH9Qey07WJYq5E1sFxo_g', 'A0MAHx9EPcOJ04PxvHekyQ', 'D1G8W0SgCbsKTv7cAqKcNg', 'sApvvvnEp4Z-4do3a1pDgg', 'z4PkzgCCNJFxlybpkbCSHg', 'e59s01jARL-4_MPMfuz4Kg', 'zHvBHjiWcMK-Q7tGQrImFA', 'jaDTgMqh4DzoLJrMrW3JcA', 'L_ZCrE7g1l_yzzNTmS8u8g', 'SSXDBAaz6Y12Mawmi2eHNw', 'cM9e72mfMtKKRmCnS1VGCA', '9M5EIzohoSndaiFkLz9bug', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', 'N_cH3QA_eXXmnzz-nzEeKA', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'GJrGPKF2xxB06Es6aH1VWg', 'gwnVSev8aNLvMArs3WTfFw', 'DMcBcl9rRKOutIJ50bG9BQ', 'qvafrUlgfjm6kc8Zk5R8jQ', '0nwGDBBbMyu1wUGhmVtMnw', 'F5WW6egmmUrIWRI_ZNpbEA', 'Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w', 'CFVTBVw4idvllFgj8noSVg', 'zvJCcrpm2yOZrxKffwGQLA', 'J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA', 'iOQt-pwKuWb-vR01NY0tlw', 'tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ', 'Or7fUkuJtQCwt4MRWF7pQg', 'tU4ZODJvuIuM2IGBhA_Hxg', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', 'nYKao-8w_IOj4Mv8QWb2vg', '9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg', 'FKosz9ExVLhsrITQk5xl4g', '0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA', '3CxWftKJAqpsYRW0FqIWeg', '5wTVzr3SyZzpiu-U_Yim6A', 'myEOtdBGvBhQDjkc2Tn27A', '3HQ8d8TvFOhGcStjP9N9bg', 'E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA', 'WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg', 'H6_0i6_B2Oj-73notsUEkw', 'ZfPLnkxTOlt6nhs19lAFPw', '2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg', 'qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ', '7we_mU7mTQTzaW74EVdY4w', 'FhNR1c3euiXzOJr05eXPeg', '9e1FWfJaSVZi1rKSmVyf0A', 's_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw', 'pdxgawR1KIucNrBQICi37g', 'tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g', 'j-W6oGoQtKnzncCRZhji1g', '2Az24juAhTJtmlqr5UWXSQ', '2SJIv03sW7T5gjT3P_nmRg']",,3,3,2,user,2,8,,4.21,1,"[2013, 2014]",Dave,49,,36,,,221,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Active Life', 'Amusement Parks']",,,Kennywood,,,,,,,,,,,,,123,,PA,,,,,,"4800 Kennywood Blvd

Yes, it is changing to keep up with its competitors but in my opinion Kennywood has prided itself on being kinda old fashioned and nostalgic. They keep taking away from that and putting in new hokey crap. (What's the deal with that shoot 'em up interactive thing) and they took out Past Time (I'm sure me and my Grammy are the only two people that will miss it, but it added so much charm) to put in games that they already have at the other end of the park?! Remodeling Noah's Ark was just unthinkable. 

Please don't misconstrue my ranting, I still love going to Kennywood. It's great for the whole family or group of friends but because I've been going since I was in utero and have seen all of the changes, it hurts my soul a little bit each time I go back.

Admission rates are becoming ridiculous - they need to put a cap on that ASAP. Thankfully, they have the night rider passes which gives old fogies like us just enough time to circle the park twice, ride our favorite rides and stuff our faces with PP fries, corn dogs, and funnel cakes.",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,3,9/2/2010,review,2,,"I had to knock a star off because of all the changes over the past few years.

UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA,wvyhah2HWb3gL34mHVhpEQ,"Oh Kennywood, how I love thee.  I'm not just saying that because I am a born and raised western Pennsylvanian.  I'm saying that because even though the size of your park is on the smaller side for an amusement park, there is never enough time to possibly cover everything there.  Thus making sure you need to come back again and again to enjoy everything if not for the first time, but as a repeat adventure.

Sadness comes and goes here as I can remember where certain rides use to be and are now replaced with newer rides...*le sigh* how I wish the Pitfall were still there or the Rotor for that matter.  But some of the newer rides were well worth the sacrifice of the old.  

Of course you can't get rid of the awesome roller coasters such as the Thunderbolt, Racer or JackRabbit.  Especially since they take advantage of the natural ravens in the area.  Even the Phantom's Revenge takes advantage of the awesome hills here.  Some of the classics are still there, I don't think I have ever ventured here and not gone on Noah's Ark, even though I know what to expect, it's like I HAVE to ride this.

This is also one of the few amusement parks where you don't have to rush yourself.  If you want to take a leisurely stroll, you can.  Why?  Because it's actually a beautiful place to walk around in.  The pathways are nicely lined with plenty of shade if you want to take a rest from the sun.

We all have that one that we call our own and we enjoy visiting over and over again.  When you have a conversation about your favorite ride, your mind automatically goes to this place.  Mine just happens to be Kennywood.  Any time you ask me about a ride, I end up comparing it to a ride here in my head.  If I am near on in another park you will usually hear me say, ""...man, this is like the one at Kennywood.""

My recent trip here I made sure to hit all of my old favorites and try out a few I hadn't.  There are very few of the latter type.  I swear I have rode just about every ride this park has to offer.  This goes back to the days of the Laser Loop and Rotor.  It is a park that is on the small side, but when you take into account how much time you still end up spending here, it ends up feeling so much bigger than the footprint in which it stands.

Let's not talk about the food in this review, I can already feel my waistline expanding.  I swear, calories do not count when you are in an amusement park.  I like the small additions they have done here and there, it makes it feel like a well oiled machine.  

Come for the entertainment, stay for the rides, and eat your heart out.

I would get new clothes to go to kennywood, plan out each ride, eat way too much funnel cake, cotton candy and potato patch fries and stay until they kicked me off the rides.

Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw,VCwMCbOHeHjrDjSuRisLgA,"It's a good time!
do *not* expect Disney or 6 Flags' Corporate look or feel.  
That's not what this park is all about!

Its a great park because of its TRADITIONAL amusement park persona.

PROS:
Wooden Roller Coaster!  (Jackrabbit & Thunderbolt)
Potato Patch Fries  (w/ Cheese or Gravy = Nomnomnom!)
Funnel Cakes
Looking @ dumb people with Fannypacks!!!

CONS:
its an aging park, therefore a bit dirty
entrance fee is waaaaaaaaaay outa-line
(""Funday Pass"" which is a ride all day pass for $35.99)
They completely screwed up the Old Mill (and now its a *little* kids' ride)

3 WISHES:
1.)  They'd make more ""Dark Rides"" (i miss the ""haunted"" types like Le Cachot, the Goldrush (I wonder what they did with that big Spider from the ceiling in there??) and the Original Old Mill.
       [http://www.laffinthedark.com/articles/lecachot/lecachot2.htm]
2.)  I wish that the Train was like it was when I was a kid!  It had funny characters all through the ride.  It was a funny ride and now its historic.
3.)  Lower the prices a tad--Kennywood will get its money one way or another, it wouldn't kill them to make that entrance fee a bit more reasonable!!!

If you're in the area, you should check it out; it is worth the trip at least every couple of years.

TIP:
If you're an adult, go after 5!
They have what's called the ""Night Rider Pass"" and if you go after 5, you can get in for  $20.99.
This still gives the average adult plenty of time to ride some of your faves, grab some fries and get outa there!   ;)

The fries are made exactly the same as the Potato Patch, but the lines are much shorter., nan",2011-07,51,553,"['Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg', 'UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ', 'fFoRIzbwpMiv3BvfdtdlXQ', 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw', 'eLacNT8zjoKTBuKt8-J4sA', 'gficpb_9hLpJEOdpaml2Dg', 'CCXAshSsHRNUtdPUsGCNiw', 'dLSjb4_VFZz07xBcsR4BiA', '9bPtL84YpUVcPonDArowhg', '-la6YVHqiwf2fR8o617mBQ', 'L_iadzEIjMF1I7GH-n-zbA', 'DMCGCo1D88u61SBx8jXAWg', 'sjSo7Bd7DHRgwWbVBOrOHw', 'clgaCFcZ0-JnM7V9DGbOlg', 'WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg', 'qlcwfLpIG62p2VccbG-idQ', 'jR_zE_9TEcY4_vrTeKNXlA', 'iCOPqpQ_mmQ3jaBP2Lz1bQ', '0mFcyRrJQhAPN0ey1FcMcA', 'V-aBUQ4Vh1EMdVmj9_mCuQ', '7KujvBtn08LWJlP018iunA', 'Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', '4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'e7lJwGbdJsrFziQoXKNJ6w', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'X2B8S8CaF6kkArIuaQ729w', 'GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'NSkLw-cg_v7YBVEwVsYj4Q', 'qvafrUlgfjm6kc8Zk5R8jQ', 'l_szjd-ken3ma6oHDkTYXg', '6xS41eiB_7MHNjT411-0Cg', 'isu68jpuwLmILlRyjzB5Ow', 'r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ', 'CC7sga0F5yS1_cvPokFBLA', '6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA', 'bZpBAaxC0L9LzrQPUJF7ew', '4oFIudKHg0Qr0Rtpi-e_Ew', 'GeK2XiAoWB11fV_xOk3vpA', 'Pc2ezRRHcXUXWXmZutQPeg', 'mdJZA5p391bCOZnvAxHV3w', 's0qiS71nzMUmqBdM4oPc7Q', '0vCEI3ZJF_gXgWHpcR7WtA', '0eonA8U6IWkIk6SRyAtiXg', 'ylIgegaQaJOjL4_lH2EkFA', 'N8VUPAhqFIk7zkoJ9qCjJg', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', '3s_b8CM6YuBIDc-UmxbMMA', 'HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', 'w16jpVr-b-0gd6YHwnIarg', '_BV9_YrP3sQlNVzaJo2z_w', 'csNALHN2BVA7hVgC9ge-VQ', 'FKosz9ExVLhsrITQk5xl4g', 'I1uUGSEDgOMs2CFjIqT7iQ', 's7SSyjzxqYqWN3joHiS52A', '0P58MD0FRVI6pTVKUpd7YA', '68vjXoLMogT5p1jb8enlVQ', 'qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ', 'hru2IDwSyN61sgWPtJw_hA', '59A-ZxUMOgIl2MAnySh-Aw', 'f9LuLzqLMNJJoV3zmu6dBA', 'wCJbSEmMeZ0mAnJRQEyfCQ', 'DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg', 'Sv0wU9iCb3Yy5Gf7k2dG4A', 'xr8TpNtlTeQHanEN3d1X4g', 'WzaaorVCmUTQvu4mScunNg', 'DLu1Bum8EXNE62xno-v0VA', 'Sjb5e5-gKoLXueFDMc2R8Q', 'bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw', 'An71ujetEmmj_3CxTJHuNg', 'jBgZ9v4pJ2LjTY0xVxGQtA', 'V1VL5qMxBQYJkzE7H1xLlQ', '9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ', '2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg', 'KSS6v5fcZNoelu4eEZCFcw', 'DwXVdLxCHp9Uag-HjWgcnQ', 'gCmTdgHJPdgOw6gkTIk6Sw', 'qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ', 'Me3F1JOgOBYhi6_Cy4_rug', '0g6YkeAqNkbrnQFfdNjw9Q', 'xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg', 'k5y8-PqGQqF2oWmxeFAneA', 'H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 'RWSBzkqH2-lsQDH8gVBuEw', 'XwRyD7_pmXPugYH83fz7yA', '3h6FcRjVC5KA_o2DGO9gWQ', 'SlKJNLm1SQdgaaKtqD--1w', 'VVP-DVzNITDwFiMyIad6XQ', 'LZlxj3maqbECm5ENroXmFw', 'vq3tbHB84SP791g1dFKXYA', 'uvXs09fVId2GarZVJq-DMg', '5GMyJufcQxwQXkWr2-G01g', 'I-ttn8-xGH_wNDsYAKt9ZQ', 's_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw', 'tOm1mQutc-UW9H4ME1HToQ', '2t1-DyiofeAg2s8yz9L9oQ', 'Z3pEOLUrG17cntPCFzruPg', 'wp7hNIfuRLAS9GTHY75Q5A', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', '64GBbjUMe_n6Yhi7OH_H6Q', 'I_aCoqtdcfWODt0iXN5MVw', 'cM_kbAlbPzNTnfbrw58NxA', 'bmy45XLtOomcc_EvC-lXRQ', 'VRB9nzZnYWB6WETk_QfIEQ', 'L_1ldS4LQxCt7cVN1tfWAQ', 'cQzLh-dCpM-C_cDYycPlww', 'WDQnQ_id2Y7iXG3qDnxCmg', 'Y33gH7R0NRx_KGwXyhKiKQ', 'WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA', 'NH8aEIKCSO_xtp54zrMoTg', 'rONxiM8Hafy5kba3ZLoCbA']",1,7,16,21,user,19,60,,4.07,1,"[2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",David,405,3,91,2,4,715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Active Life', 'Amusement Parks']",,,Kennywood,,,,,,,,,,,,,123,,PA,,,,,,"4800 Kennywood Blvd

The Phantom's Revenge and Sky Rocket were amazing.  They were completely smooth, yet thrilling rides.

The park is landscaped very well and many lines are under the shade of the trees, so you're not waiting while the sun beats down on you.  

When first pulling into the park (free parking) you get a fair-like feeling....but upon entering you'll see it's a full-fledged park.  Then, travel through a magical tunnel to a world of fun.

Riding things that were there for almost 100 years is kind of special.

I definitely recommend Kennywood.

More than a few rides were out of order or just not running the day we went.

Thunderbolt and the jack rabbit are memory makers. It's a terrific place to spend quality time with the family. The food prices are high but they do allow coolers so bring plenty of water and snacks to eat. Be sure to have a funnel cake and some potato patch French fries. The ticket prices seem high for an amusement park of the magnitude however it's not Disney expensive so I guess that's a plus. There is free parking. It is supposed to be a smoke free environment but of course pittsburghers scoff at that notion.,0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,4,6/10/2015,review,0,,"Have loved this Pittsburgh tradition since I was a small child.

#NAME?,uJA7TSFn-D3s7jDdPj2MiQ,"KENNYWOOD! Oh jeebus, just thinking of Kennywood makes me feel like the happiest person in the world. I grew up in Pittsburgh and had the most fun there. I still have a lot of family, so every time we visit and Kennywood is open, we go. It is seriously the funnest place EVER, and I've never been to anything else like it. I only hate that they made the Old Mill a hideous garfield ride... seriously, garfield?? WHY? And there are so few Old Mills left as is ): Can't stand the redone Noah's Ark either, but I guess they felt forced to update. It would just be cool if parks could keep their oldest rides as they were from the beginning for history's sake. Kennywood has still been pretty good at keeping that old fashioned spirit alive though.

Big scary rollercoasters terrify me, but I'm SO in love with the jack rabbit (that double dip rocks), the racer, and of course the thunderbolt. Mmmm. Also, the log jammer is cheesy but amazing, and I love the rapids, dirty water and all. I am also ALL about the whip, the turtle, and the bavarian swings. I always go on the Olde Kennywood Railroad, and that laughing animatronic woman is HIDEOUS... but awesome.

Oh yes, and the final ride of all, the ski lift up to your car. I find it actually more terrifying than any of the thrill rides D: shudder.

Anyway, I have so many wonderful memories of Kennywood, and I know I will always return to make more (:

One that you can wander happily through while marveling at the sight of the lights and the sounds of caliope Christmas carols.   We enjoyed the scent of the campfires scattered throughout the park to warm our hands and the comforting smells of hot cocoa and warm cider to warm our tummies.  All the while, the sounds of  ooohs and aaahs of children (and adults) warmed our hearts.  

What to do?  Ride the Merry-go-Round, or the Kennywood train that takes you through a light display that on Saturday night included a great big beautiful full moon.   It actually rivaled the lights of the Christmas displays!   Kiddieland was filled with little ones, moms and dads and grandparents, too.  Almost all the rides in Kiddieland were open.  There were more adult rides open than I imagined there would be and more than advertised.  And to top it off, all the rides were decorated with Christmas lights!

There were ice carvers, miniature train displays, cookie decorating, Santa Claus himself and all the Kennywood characters all waiting to greet excited boys and girls and the adults with them.  Flashes of cameras were exploded all over the place as memories were captured of the very first, and hopefully JUST the first, new Pittsburgh Christmas tradition,...Kennywood Christmas in the park.

Kennywood is amazing. There. Review over. Wait, I need to back up my statement, you say?

-Kennywood is a historic landmark in Pittsburgh. Where else can you enjoy a day at an amusement park and still say you visited a historic place?

-Potato Patch Fries. Just, Potato Patch fries. You feel the months slipping off of your life and you don't even care while eating them!

-Classic wooden coasters - Jackrabbit, anyone?

-Contemporary coasters - Phantom's Revenge, anyone?

-Great rides in general - Name any ride you like here.

-Special events - I adore Kennywood's special events. Fright Night's here are a lot of fun - and as packed as it can get, a Fright Night here still allows you to enjoy far more than a Halloween event at bigger places like Cedar Point. Kennywood also has one of the most beautiful Christmas Light Shows you'll ever set eyes on, and believe me, it is well worth venturing from your house to see these (yes, even when the temperature drops to single digits. Or maybe I'm just insane).

If you haven't been here yet, check it out. If you haven't been here yet and you live nearby, FOR SHAME! And go check it out - as soon as the snow melts and they reopen.",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,5,2/19/2013,review,0,,"I feel like this may be the most unnecessary of all of my reviews.

Parking is easy in their huge lot and not terribly far from the main entrance.  Walked thru security easily enough (ok, forgot to empty my cell phone in the tray first go-round). 

We were greeted with light displays throughout, a giant Christmas Tree with lights galore (good for the picture backdrop), vendors open for food and drink, restaurants open and busy, games open and ready to take our money (we passed on that though tempting to have my husband win me a Sponge Bob for a Christmas present (not)), rides open (most for the small tots but the Pirate ship was open for your swaying pleasure (not mine)), bonfires blazing to keep hands warm (definitely took advantage of that), plenty of restrooms existed, a kid's magician was performing (we clapped), and a 4D performance of a 12 minute long ""Polar Express"" was playing (however, the line was longer than we cared to wait).

We also went in the Noah's Ark ride... which was interesting... and Ghostwood Estate where you have to shoot targets with laser guns., nan",2007-08,35,1023,"['uguXfIEpI65jSCH5MgUDgA', 'Rir-YRPPClKXDFQbc3BsVw', 'KUtzHIs-Y2Va3STDlWa0iA', 'DrKQzBFAvxhyjLgbPSW2Qw', 'vyfsQo-estP8EfiIFMsL6g', 'p4Jg_rO_AsCWZGMd_w8xjw', 'wiE8owjhxXYpOxCcYKhbiA', 'AaZdXn0I6F5bdIVwGpxdDA', 'NhXOaROBjlU-IuQrmWrQYQ', 'kCTnDWHBiBktXougIKRMtA', 'L5e5_gNEA3N-B4swnYVLLA', '3gBhA4bNoPWQYeONL5NPQQ', '10dhZs996tBtJq2nd_mcRg', 'UTGqubcmDv1cNe5-k8-OeA', 'ZR_GsPdyPy6etuucvk0j_A', 'SJVt7_0p3b6H9Vfo7cfC1Q', 'KxpvO1f0OvthdI3zKz0DVw', 'dB1jz76Yqs7uZhTaSC1CVQ', '1Tt5MmNF7iedrWd88Y4F0w', '6rLeqh49yjCGNfx6IEHV5g', 'IyEdBo884XBPmNLhIp8dig', 'smywkyAyBdVdpfxuBsKlnA', 'J72hf_DSYNo0IbvgxVCp1w', 'tcKH661Mylv2W3_vxXajEA', 'uPcR2D5dyvLlgvdEMgitUg', 'VRCl0XzcC3n5RzfuU3gu3w', '7V6RYBSmpoHsVkohGD_yGg', 'AgARllvBE2wIopbJSuSXPg', 'wtetKGea0cE6J4iE6GK5Vw', '4wFc5s1BxoC4PjS1tHd6ow', 'C1NCPmIP-sXfYm5Ywhjj9A', 't3rZpAy4CrPi3kuJGfuCTA', 'FQBsSK8bOMfcu1pnwDKFtg', 'gyBs-PcHasLx7IF9B6OBZA', 'EehzZsq_ArpkCc4E2hyL4Q', 'OGrC0zgDNtKUCLobXPJRVA', '5u7KoDrzJDN1bn38v9ppZw', 'slEelODc0ClPx2kKVC0xiQ', 'wx12_24dFiL1Pc0H_PygLw', 'gxOZMidTXSm2z_0AecgbGw', 'GAeM4pken2drf7CpuKHuLg', 'KA4PQOvc21KRCnGS6laDew', 'qN6SH4CKMG46LNkl8zL8sg', '4rJ8xrKHYcWcRy7ZkCf3UA', 'NCotrIxIJK1IaDKCI9u4FQ', 'GUS-L9GY4PibH1mfqaRZug', '0-SZCLONHQvilp7Ezht9Ew', 'a59UEZCcCy822KUeYtaWOw', 'f9gwMgQEK46pz5mqyDT_VQ', 'fRnnWwGlKblflhViFlo9tg', 'syd-OyIBnpXvujIDynqwXg', 'cN_ZGu1ISXyGwW5qIxcRLA', 'OT_QOBZaVpz0LEQ0eXNbPw', 'Cm733GjggtI9Ts-71C4Fvw', '7Ja9YSDZjsOejYnEHcOj5w', 'S74ILjnAHR8LeRYKXnEHwg', 'sAbqLSzz-0L98VNYWF6vow', 'yJt2gQhLh5anhgqAS4xtNQ', '_sMNrdNz2vQGfQ_IjbUkQw', 'UK42vIAMMCn66HY2BL2PGg', '4A3dQlNtdL8uaMgXbHIEHg', 'xRVAjefQzbd1hvwrHmUHqw', '7E5cTuA0Zt3xFbKNKaU9-Q', 'h0GeK8RLi_8pIJknKLxDRA', '_UFwgH0LPqEyqTViomnHcw', 'RChwmeJYH9okLdE8uZ52QA', 'zOk-Hsuwh1CPcNjGoRNEAg', 'DvpUCL8h6QVU-Cb258cCeQ', '_by6AER0fuS6y2pzvqtJKw', '6RL4G20UEMXe_62ZOoRFag', '7B8a5gx40s7QM6HWmUZtrw', '9hokwHFiV13JzfLi4ZYtgw', 'GAbqb6LcYyX9Q9CBPOqe2w', 'R7KdetFVtrsBk4MHP7h0uA', 'SIAM_mqB4KmLpNRbc2PlyA', '8FS84rp2EVQH-h1OWwPaIw', 'SVAU7yfM-NSpb9K_ZV_4gg', 'nWx9UABa0zPYIWk4Yfkbyg', '2IApW43hiwz7qQSjuqvdmg', '-C-AiP1yuA87ZC1JhxGG2g']",1,36,27,25,user,27,69,5,4.1,7,"[2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",Jason,540,1,680,,32,1037,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"['Active Life', 'Amusement Parks']",,,Kennywood,,,,,,,,,,,,,123,,PA,,,,,,"4800 Kennywood Blvd

E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA,fxbuDwfbfO_T0YRyd-oPAw,"A great old theme park with a carnival feel. It has good rides, we love the potato patch fries, cotton candy and funnel cake! The new rides they have added are pretty sweet and more modern. They have a new sky coaster as well as the black widow which i was almost too terrified to get on. As you enter the park, they play that old timey music that sounds like your on a carrousel. You enter into this tunnel and when you come out on the other side it's Kennywood. That exciting feeling of all the memories you had as a kid growing up and going here for school picnics. 

I'm afraid of heights but i always love to get on rides that take you up high..except the pit fall, i never really enjoyed that ride. That's probably why they too it down. But they replaced it with the black widow which may have become my new favorite ride at kennywood. It's similar to the sling shot but twice as high and it slowly spins around. Before getting on this ride i was soooo terrified. I thought i was gonna scream my lungs out but the ride looks scarier from the ground than it does up in the air. it almost feels like your riding a bike down a very steep hill or like skydiving! all the wind and the fact that you get so high all you can see is the sky and nothing else is absolutely amazing. it feels like your being launched to the moon.

They have plenty of fun games for you to play and an arcade for younger kids. I always see someone walking around with one of those big rasta bananas...:D my favorite rides are the log jammer, all the coasters, swing shot, turtle, noah's ark, pirate ship and the black widow. I would like to include the exterminator but that ride can be brutal if you ride with a partner. The steel side bars press into your arm as your partner is slammed into you, i ended up with a bruise on my arm. 

Other than the great rides and picnic area for family get togethers, i must say that the food is pretty amazing. The fries as you know is the best part of the whole park, that and the funnel cake  with strawberry and ice cream on top. I love it sooo much and we try to get it every time. If anyone is looking for a great family outing with plenty of ride for the babies and the grade schoolers, this is the place to go. My niece loves the baron curve which i think is a little too fast for a 6 year old but hell if she likes it so do I.",1,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,4,8/27/2013,review,0,,"A great old theme park with a carnival feel.

iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,wrjfvbErdxiTTr6PPTj47w,"Kennywood!  Ah Kennywood!  How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways....

That Kennywood Park is one of the last and oldest traditional amusement parks around is enough to give a five-star rating.  No ""themes"", few characters, and the emphasis is just on having good ol' fashioned clean fun and being a kid again for a day!

If you've read some of my earlier threads, you'll know that I, Susan D, am a rollercoaster daredevil.  There's no rollercoaster that I can't tame!  But more on that in a moment.  Let's begin with the ""next best"" group of rides, the ""classic"" thrill rides.  Why is it that the oldest thrill rides are the most fun?  I'm referring specifically to ""The Whip"", which was built in 1919--yes the ride is almost 90 years old!  It's a good ol' fashioned  ""crack-the-whip"" ride, which 16 cars  travel an elliptical track and ""whip"" the riders as they go around the bend at either end.  It is NASTY!    Then there's ""The Kangaroo"", which simulates the effect of a Kangaroo jumping. Once a regular in amusement parks, it is the last remaining of its kind.  WICKED!

Want to get wet?  Kennywood has three rides that will take care of that!  ""Raging Rapids"" is your typical rapids ride.  ""Log Jammer"" is still there too.  My personal favorite is the ""Pittsburg Plunge""  (no 'H' at the end--that's how the city was originally spelled).  This is based on a ride at the old Riverview Park in Chicago in which several people are seated in a boat that hurtles down a chute towards a big splash at the end.

And finally, as promised, we come to the rollercoasters!  THESE are why I go to any amusement park.  Which are better, the clanky old coasters from the 1920s or the smooth steel coasters of today?  Or is it a moot point?  Naturally I have to ride each at least twice--once in front for the view and once in back for the G-forces.  ""The Racer"" is a twin-racing coaster from 1927.  Next is ""The Jackrabbit"", from 1921, with it's notorious ""double-dip"".  Then we come to ""The Thunderbolt"", still a perennial in every roller-coaster aficionado's ""top-ten"" list.  Finally, there is ""The Phantom's Revenge""--a refashioning of the 1991 ""Steel Phantom"".  I'm still undecided on whether or not Iike the new version better.  One thing is for sure, I do miss the ""Steel Phantom's"" loops.  But on this coaster, the biggest drop on this ride is not the first but the second.  It drops 230 feet and reaches 85mph!  Oh, and the second drop is hidden, so if you're riding with a newbie, don't tell that person!

Oh, and I like the merry-go-round too!",4,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,1,5,8/11/2008,review,4,,"Kennywood!  Ah Kennywood!  How do I love thee?  Let me count the ways....

iTmWHtltCtk0Gm55AOxrUA,wPSsr16KjWfP0TwKAgSJWw,"The Racer is Kennywood's second oldest rollercoaster after the Jack Rabbit. Built in 1927, it's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster. What's a moebius (mobius) loop racing coaster? Well it's a racing coaster that appears to have two continuous loops (ala the American Eagle at Six Flags or the Gemini at Cedar Point), but really has only one continuous track. So you end up on the opposite side of the station from where you started. There are only three remaining coasters of this type in the world. The other two are in Mexico City and Blackpool. 

The Racer was designed and built by John Miller and its trains are classics built by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company. PTC built some of some of the most famous coasters and their trains. Its tallest vertical height is 76 feet, its maximum drop is 50 feet, and its top speed is 40mph. Of the three woodies at Kennywood (this, the Jack Rabbit and the Thunderbolt), the Racer is the only one in which the initial hill is also the lift hill. When built, it cost the then-princely sum of $76,000! Imagine what the designers back then would have thought of what the newest coasters cost! 

Ready to take a ride? 

Okay, let's get on the train on the right! It doesn't really matter where we sit on this one, so maybe we'll just park in the middle. The alarm bell rings, the brakes are released and we begin rolling towards the lift hill. We won't see our opponents until we're almost on the lift hill. The lift chain catches and we're inching our way up the hill. We're about a foot in front of them. We see the warning sign as near the top telling us not to stand up. Well duh, but I'll bet some moron has tried that! 

The lift chain releases and we we're down the first drop, then a quick ascent, then a reverse curve. Because we're on the inside of the curve, we pull out to an early lead. Uh oh, that can't be good. Read on. We keep our early lead for awhile but remember, sometimes we're on the inside curve, sometimes on the outside. The great thing about the Racer is that some of the curves are so tight, we can reach out and high-five our opponents http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Racer-handslap.jpg Remember, it's not a tradition--it's a requirement! 

The present Racer replaced an earlier one built in 1910, which was a side-friction coaster like Leap the Dips at Lakemont Park. The present Racer's cars are locked to the track, thus allowing banked curves as well as dips on the curves. We can see how this has come into play 'cos even though we've been ahead, on the final curve our opponents have pulled into a late lead and are first back into the station! 

Shite! We lost! 

The Racer really doesn't have the G-forces or the airtime hills of the Jack Rabbit or the Thunderbolt. It doesn't have the Thunderbolt's speed or wicked drops either. But it's still got a great rough ride and it's still a blast. The Racer is an ACE (American Coasters Enthusiasts) Classic and on June 21st, 2010 the Racer was declared an ACE Coaster Landmark http://www.aceonline.org/census/PhotoDetail.aspx?ID=9628",2,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,1,4,5/6/2011,review,1,,"The Racer is Kennywood's second oldest rollercoaster after the Jack Rabbit.

With such glowing comments from people who knew I was going to Kennywood, I figured how could I not love this place?!  Although it left me worried that if I didn't love it, I would be disowned by my Pittsburgh friends and family.

I think a large part of the allure of Kennywood is how nostalgic it makes people feel.  Every person who has talked about it has fond memories from their childhood or HS.  And this ranges from people age 6 to age 96.  And that is pretty awesome.  

I enjoyed my day at Kennywood.  It's size is managable for a day of fun and it packs a lot of adventure in a somewhat small area.  I love that there is something for everyone.  Thrill seekers have great coasters.  Families have kiddie land and those that prefer the tame have the Garfield boat ride, the Noah's Ark and the Whip.  

Make sure you bring your appetite!  The food is above average compared to most other parks.  Of course, there is the famous Potato Patch, but don't miss out on hand battered corn dogs, hand dipped ice cream cones and hot and tasty funnel cakes!

Kennywood is just an ol' Amrikan classic to me. It's not Cedar Point and really shouldn't be judged against it. Despite coming up with rides as modern and great as the Steel Phantom and the Phantom's Revenge, it manages to keep that olden feel about it; perhaps a metaphor for Pittsburgh itself, methinks.

The coasters are fun. The games are impossible to win (sour spot for me). The atmosphere is great. And yes, Potato Patch Fries. I love me some rollercoasters but honestly one of the more enjoyable rides is the Swings.

I grew up five minutes away and Kennywood was like our equivalent of a playground; so many of my childhood memories are here that it will always be viewed through the haze of nostalgia.

That said, I'll give it a shot. Fair warning: This is going to be long. I hadn't been to Kennywood in at least five years. That's the longest I've ever gone without a visit, but I had a broken foot and then was out of state. I hadn't been there since the park changed owners.

A friend and I went this past Saturday, on the last weekend of the season, on a gorgeous, cool-but-sunny day, and the park was packed. They were also understaffed -- this happens after many of the staff go back to college. As a result, the lines for everything were just ridiculous: Food, rides, bathrooms, everything. One of the reasons I like Kennywood so much more than, say, Cedar Point, is that I remembered not having to wait in line for most of the day. That definitely wasn't the case this time, but I'll write it off to circumstance and try again next year.

THE RIDES: 
I've been on every ride in the park except the Skycoaster and the SwingShot. Kennywood has some great older rides (hello, Turtle!) as well as newer stuff like this year's Sky Rocket. The latter looks kind of like it might be dinky and un-fun when you're standing in line, but it turns out it's hilariously amazing. That first hill is practically straight up and straight down, and the magnetic propulsion makes for an absolutely smooth ride.

My favorite will probably always be the Thunderbolt, though. There's nothing like dropping down into the ravines over near the river, and then getting squished (or being the squisher) into the outside of the seat. Twice. The Racer is unique in this country, and quite a lot of fun, but the double dip in the Jack Rabbit is more awesome (if you ask me).

We waited in line for 40 minutes or so to go on Ghostwood Estate, a ride that replaced the Gold Rusher. You get a blaster and try to shoot targets throughout the ride, and it tallies up a score for you in your car. The only thing is, unless you hit the targets, almost nothing happens -- and they're everywhere, so I was so busy trying to hit them that I didn't really get to enjoy the ride. Meh, says I.

Because Phantom Fright Nights are coming up, some of the rides were already closed (the Whip, the Old Mill aka Garfield's Stupid Nightmare Please Tell Me This License is Ending Soon), as was the Penny Arcade. They used to put signs up at the gates listing closed rides, which I didn't notice this time. Then again, I'm not sure anyone goes to ride the Whip or the Old Mill. Oh, and in years-old news, can I just say rebranding the Enterprise as ""The Volcano"" is really lame?

THE FOOD:
Well, you know, Patch fries. Are they that awesome? In my memory, they are. In reality (and someone is going to take away my Kennywood badge for this one)... well... er. They're good, but e.g. Mandy's has better fresh-cut fries. Patch fries are a bit overcooked and kind of soggy. But! you can get them with cheese, gravy, BBQ salt and ketchup for slightly under $4 -- all the toppings you want are included -- and that isn't bad. They used to advertise no waiting at the Small Fry location in Lost Kennywood, which definitely was not the case on this visit.

The food lines were so long we didn't end up eating anything else in the park, so everything else here is from memory. I couldn't even get a refill for my (really expensive) souvenir cup because we didn't feel like standing in line for half an hour to do so.

Weirdly, they had a little roped-off tent area with beer and brats. Beer! At Kennywood! We didn't try it, assuming it was Really Expensive. I did, however, stop in the Kandy Kaleidoscope for a real candy apple. Taffy apples have their place, but not when that's all you can get. The hard red shell is the way to go. Mine was sadly ruined by humidity and almost ripped my teeth out, this time. The fudge used to be good; all they had left was peanut butter, which I don't like, so I didn't try any.

THE REST:
Kennywood has lots of benches, trees and shade. If you need a break, it's easy to sit down and watch people walk by for a little while. The overall atmosphere is that of a great old-school amusement park. Unfortunately they got rid of general admission and tickets, so your non-riding friends or grandparents have to pay almost $40 now to get in. The grounds used to be really well maintained but it seemed like the gardens were in need of some attention, as well as most of the paint throughout the park. There was more trash than I'm used to seeing, and no sweeperettes. What?

I think Kennywood is maybe not as great as it once was, but I'm probably being a true yinzer about it. Change is bad! I'll keep going, though.",2,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,1,4,9/19/2011,review,2,,"It's next to impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Kennywood.

The great part being the rarity of starting the ride by going directly into the first drop rather than being pulled up the first hill. The Phantom's Revenge is still one of my favorite metal coasters. Not so new either, but the oddity of the biggest drop being the 2nd is still a great draw. Also, some new favorites like the Sky Rocket, which I would compare to the Maverick at Cedar Point, but much shorter (both in duration and line), and my new personal favorite, The Black Widow.

jR_zE_9TEcY4_vrTeKNXlA,2VZR0dpAHM1LSrZoxbEF1Q,"I haven't been to many amusement parks in my lifetime. I've visited Cedar Point and Universal, but I think that's about it. Kennywood is a park I've been very curious about, but I could never afford to go. Sunday I met up with the Yelp Elite team, and we had a blast. 

Kennywood is so special and unique. It offers a homey feel that makes you feel like you are instantly amongst friends and family. There are so many friendly and happy faces, pleasant personalities and fun to be had. Ride operators were focused and kind, and OF COURSE they seemed a little bored and hot, but it was so different from other experiences I've had with park employees. 

There is shade and greenery throughout the whole park, as well as misters and areas to cool off. Designated smoking benches keep the yuckiness away from non-smokers. I really appreciated that feature. 

Food stands were also willing to give out free cups of ice water. A lot of parks won't do this, so I was grateful. I have a medical condition that can be deadly if my electrolytes become imbalanced, so that was a huge plus and source of gratefulness. 

I'm super excited that Kennywood has a Johnny Rocket's now, but I am disappointed that Johnny's doesn't have their famous steamroller veggie burger available yet. Hopefully they will before I visit the park again.

As for the rides, Kennywood doesn't have the fastest, or the best or necessarily the fanciest rides. That is not why you come to Kennywood. You come here for the history, the beauty behind nearly 100-year old engineering and architecture. Some of these coasters are just amazing because of what they represent. It's really neat to go back in time and experience something that was once a really big deal.

I rode my first rollercoaster at Kennywood, and it was unforgettable. The Jack Rabbit is a mild ride, but I was still scared. As a wooden coaster, it was a bit bumpy, but it wasn't uncomfortable. I got off with the biggest grin on my face. The second coaster I rode was Phantom's Revenge. This is a really nice steel coaster with smooth curves and drops. I was once again, terrified. It wasn't as bad as I thought though, and the views were great at distracting me from my crippling fear. My favorite ride of all was definitely The Thunderbolt. It's a wooden coaster, but it's not as jerky as you could think. It's smooth, the curves are fun, the dips are even more fun, and it just feels like a solid choice to ride again and again. I love The Thunderbolt, and I truly look forward to riding it more! I couldn't get sick of it. 

Kennywood has a lot of unique things that you won't find anywhere else. If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't been, just go already! If you are visiting and looking for something fun, go! Really!

I try to go once a year and when my sister and niece asked me to take a day off and go, I was all in. We had a wonderful day, albeit a little warm but there weren't long lines and it wasn't crowded. The roller coasters are awesome even though I only got on 2 (I was surprised at that, the niece rode the Jack Rabbit for the first time:)! Awesome!). Rode some calmer rides like the train and the turtles and even cooled off on Raging Rapids (of course rotating under the waterfall so everyone in the boat is drenched). Stopped and got Potato Patch fries...if you are going to Kennywood they are a must! Oh, the first basket I got were so good that I went and got more! They were cooked to perfection the day we were there. They are terrific with the bacon and cheese however ketchup and garlic salt are tasty too!:) Also, stop and get a hand dipped ice cream cone near Kiddyland. Wow! So satisfying especially on a hot day! It is vanilla ice cream atop a cone and the ice cream is dipped in chocolate and rolled in either chocolate or rainbow sprinkles or peanuts topped with a cherry! Yum! The niece got the deep fried oreos which she loves! (They are pretty good as I have tried them before) and don't forget funnel cake although it was dry the day we were there. Bummer!

And, the admission is only $10 more. (This didn't matter because I scored a FREE ticket when I went HOLLA) So, with so few coasters, how can Kennywood possible match up?

1. Once you've gone to Cedar Point on a Saturday, you'll appreciate a visit to Kennywood. THE LINES ARE SHORT! I was in total disbelief at how short of a time I had to wait to get on.

2. My sister and her 2 year old were in town. Before visiting I read on the site about a kid swop. You can hang out with your 2 year old while friends wait in line. Then, you get to hand off the kid to the people you are with and take their spot on the ride. I felt like I was getting no wait vip spots because they waited for the front seat. Definitely a perk if you have a child with you! 

3. Great for kids. I'd love to see a new roller coaster though. After riding wooden coasters I feel like I've been beat up.

3. Great for kids. I'd love to see a new roller coaster though. After riding wooden coasters I feel like I've been beat up. 

4. Free parking.

Now I'm not expecting the magic kingdom, but places like Busch Gardens in Virginia, Dollywood in Tennessee and Hershey park put Kennywood to shame. 

Season pass holders are only allowed to use 2 of the 12 entry lines but people with single day tickets are allowed to use the season pass line. 

You have to wait ten minutes in line even if you only want a drink refill. In Dollywood they have self serve drink stations like you see in fast food restaurants. You can only buy souvenir cups at the park and you just refill them whenever. 

4 or 5 rides are always closed.  

You can get in a 10:15 with a premium season pass but the rides don't start opening until 11. That's the dumbest thing ever. What benefit is there to getting in early when nothing is open. 

For the price of a season pass, it'll serve the purpose because of the decent kiddy land but once my kid is around ten we'll just takes trips to Hershey, Cedar point or Busch Gardens.",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,2,6/18/2015,review,1,,"So freaking ghetto.

HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA,_Ak2lVPsGhZ3M4wPz1weGQ,"I love, love, love the Jack Rabbit! I also really enjoy the Thunderbolt and the Racers, too but the Jack Rabbit holds a special place in my heart. I've hit a lot of coasters all over the place and I've never found its equal anywhere else. Those double dips that make you fly out of your seat force you squeal (or scream) and giggle every darned time no matter how old you are. I dare you to keep your arms up in the air thru both dips!

I ride lots of the old school rides but the old wooden coasters are always my favorites. The goal is always to get the front car for all of them at least once during any Kennywood visit and I usually leave at the end of the day feeling like my brains have been scrambled in my head a bit. That's how you know you've taken full advantage!

There's no other amusement park quite like Kennywood. It's such a Pittsburgh institution and I'm not sure if you put the exact same park anywhere else in the Universe that it would develop the hometown, happy vibe that our Kennywood has. It's a school & company picnic institution and having tons of people you know during your visit just makes it that much better. We always had prearranged times to meet the kids by the Turtles or Noah's Ark once they were old enough to ditch the parents and hang out with their friends. They would tell us what time to be at the Skycoaster to watch them & their friends take the big freefall dive from an impossibly high platform as they all screamed their lungs out.

My friends and I have joked that there should be an eat all day pass available. I'm typically not a French fry lover but if all fries tasted like they do from the Potato Patch, I might feel differently. Then their are the corn dogs, Dippin Dots, Dip Cones, fresh squeezed lemonade, etc. Sorry a funnel cake just seems like overkill with all that!

From the chair lift from the top parking lot, to the potato patch fries, right up to the Racer wooden coaster... it has history and is so much fun.

While they don't have a lot of options for true expansion as it's perched precariously on a hill leading down to a valley, steel mills, train tracks, and the Monongahela  River; the still find a way to add a new ride or revamp old ones here and there. Touting multiple wooden coasters, the Phantom's Revenge steel coaster, the SkyRocket, and the Exterminator (an indoor coaster). There are water rides for those people who find themselves inclined to walk around in wet clothes all day. 

The food is pricey, but I don't think it's possible to go to to Kennywood and not have Potato Patch fries. If you're not so inclined to eat the food there, you can bring coolers and eat at the car or in one of the picnic table areas. My only real qualm with this park is no alcohol is served here. I love being able to drink outdoors, and at an amusement park could be a blast.

The park is full of beautiful history and you can find several places with old photos of the park from back in it's very early start.

NmJ0tN6f61sS7mwg7HM0VQ,4sr3JIQaNHaFfhEi44LkCw,"So I do not do bad reviews very much, so please know I am not an anal, picky person who gives a poor rating for a dumb reason. I am a realist and worked in the service industry for over 10 years, so I keep that in mind. With that said, there are a few key reasons why I am reviewing Kennywood and giving them the poor score. 

Pricing- Adult rider is anyone over 46 inches at $41.99 per person. Junior rider is anyone under 46 inches at $28.99 per person. Kids 2 years and under are free...how you prove their age, I don't know. Doesn't sound bad but unfortunately, my husband and I both agree when we say about 85% of the regular rides require a rider to be above 46 inches. So Junior riders have to stick with KiddieLand and a handful of rides... Is it just me or is it extremely expensive for a little kid to go to KiddieLand? Or go on The Whip? No roller coaster, no Black Widow...no Racers. 

Repairs and upkeep-The past 3 times we have been to Kennywood many rides have been closed or a portion of them are broken...but the ride is still open!  This equals long lines and long periods of staring and dwelling in the local ""aromas"". Granted it does get hot and there are tons of people there but through long waits we have noticed that everything is dirty and smells like an un-flushed toilet. The water there is pungent and many of the roller-coasters reeked of mildew. Many buildings, rails, posts, columns etc need repainted terribly and the landscape is incredibly boring.  Sorry if my expectations are too uptight but if you are charging an arm and a leg just for admission, maybe you should make sure the experience parallels the cost or lower your pricing. 

So if you want to go to a anti-family amusement park that does not cater to kids, budgets or cares about customers experience...then by all means go to Kennywood.  If you do want something better, check out my favorite park so far, Waldameer and Waterworld at waldameer.com or my next favorite Idlewild and Soak Zone at www.idlewild.com. They at least keep families in mind and both have a water park that you can include in admission. FYI, Kennywood has only 3 water rides...

No, I'd like to share my very confusing and bizarre experience with the Dippin' Dots stand. I forget the exact location, but it's near the water area with the Sky Drop.

I was buying two kinds of ""sundaes"" from the stand, deciding to get the Gummy Yummy (?) for myself while my boyfriend wanted Banana Split. No problem, I mean they're like $4.25 each but that's the magic of Kennywood.

When trying to order, reading off the menu above me, I was met with a blank look from the dude working there. He was slow to respond and I guess I didn't really hear quite what he said, but at the time I believed he was saying they were out of the supplies for the Gummy sundae. No problem dude, I say, I'll take the peanut butter cup one instead. Another long look from the guy behind the counter but he soon proceeded in due course.

Whatever I got was pretty much vanilla dots with scant chocolate chunks and a few mouse-size peanut butter cups. They have no right to call this thing a sundae. That ain't the dude's fault, though.

Afterward when I was pondering wtf just happened, my boyfriend pointed out that when I ordered the gummy sundae the guy working the stand had told me point blank he had no idea what that was.

What does Kennywood have that the corporate parks don't?
-Affordable admissions prices
-Quality park food and affordable prices (Potato Patch, hello?)
-A fun atmosphere that isn't dominated by arbitrary ""rules"" and ""policies""
-Classic rides that you can't find anywhere else

Kennywood doesn't have the most roller coasters, but who cares? The rides that the park does have are downright fun. Seriously, have you ever been on a wooden coaster at Cedar Point or Kings Island? OUCH!

If you want to pay for a close-in parking space, that's cool; if not, that's OK too. At Kennywood, you can bring your own picnic lunch INTO the park. Unlike the corporate parks, I never feel like I'm being gouged or taken advantage of while inside the gates.

It is the most beautiful looking amusement park I have ever seen.

Pros
1) The Woodies. Thunderbolt, Racer, and Jack Rabbit. I love hearing the thundering trains as they speed down the track, and I love the smell of the oil used to make the ride go smoothly. Smelling it, makes me feel like I'm 9 years old again.
2) Potato Patch Cheese Fries.
3) Walking through Noah's Ark
4) People watching, especially when unexpected people get splashed on the overlook of the Pittsburg Plunge. Hahaha, take that jerks :O
5) Phantom!!!
6) Great firework shows
7) Best games ever!
8) Penny Arcade
9) Photo Ops with that Kangaroo
10) Just the sounds man

Cons
1) Where the new ride at??? Cedar Point gets 2 this year, Kennywood is 2 years past due. At least throw in a Scrambler or a Trabant. Anything, keep it fresh.
2) The dark rides aren't as dark as they used to be. I miss the Old Mill and Le Cachot. Now it's too kid-orientated.
3) Why can't you be open today??? lol, seriously, where my new ride at? Also, what up on that park expansion deal.  
 
Despite them 3 cons, the pros outweigh it, which is why I give it 5. If there isn't a new ride next season, I'm going to de-star this place a notch.",1,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,1,5,5/3/2014,review,2,,"I love Kennywood with a passion and I can't wait until it opens for the season.

If you don't plan in advance, it can be expensive.  But, Kennywood gives you a chance to do it cheap, unlike other amusement parks.  You can get the cheap-o weekday tix at Giant Eagle for $26.  AND you can bring in your own food.

Don't like lines?  Go on a really hot weekday.  We waited max 15   minutes... even for the new coaster!  And if you don't wanna wait in the big Potato Patch line, try the little patch in Lost Kennywood.  Same fries, tiny line.

uitwtyQBgRMDX05XsVJx5A,f6V6urlJhywgsQI2GofgMg,"Not a big park, but a unique one. Situated near the edge of a forested mountain overlooking the river, this park is lovely on a nice day.  There are 3 great old wooden coasters, one extremely fun modern one,  a unique fun house, a kiddie land and a few old school rides you won't find many other places.

However, I've made so many memories at this amusement park, I don't think it could get any better for me, personally.  This place is classic.  Even in my mid-twenties I felt giddy as I walked through the tunnel to enter the park.  

PROS:
-Wooden coasters- the Jack Rabbit, the Racer, the Thunderbolt.... classic bumpy, creaky, bounce out of your seat fun!
-Potato patch french fries (LOTS of vinegar and Heinz ketchup!)
-Classic rides like the swings, the merry go round, the paratrooper, the turtle, the turnpike and gran prix, Noah's Ark
- Funnel cakes
- Fresh squeezed lemonade
- Kiddie land


CONS:
-Small-ish lockers.  We had a hard time fitting our cooler.
-The new Noah's Ark.  What happened to the whale's tongue?  And why is it so scary now?  Our kids were pretty freaked out and didn't really enjoy it at all.
-Garfield's Nightmare.  AWFUL.  A waste of 45 minutes of my life.  They took out the Old Mill and disgraced the park with a cheesy, slow moving ride that tactlessly promotes brand name sodas, potato chips and other junk food, which, surprise, surprise! they sell at a stand at the end of the ride.  Pathetic.  And what's with the camera at the end of the ride?  All they're going to catch on that camera are people sleeping or being bored to tears.  If you haven't picked up on my subtle hints, let me spell it out for you: DON'T GO ON THIS RIDE!

Compared to other amusement parks, Kennywood also has GREAT food!  I have to have that duble heder ice cream cone - gimme chocolate, nuts and a cherry, please!

The new-ish Ghostwood Estate ride is fun - shooting a little laser blaster all over the place can't be that bad, right?  And Noah's Ark is a classic walk-through (slightly updated) that some people might think is lame, but you should check it out if only for a little bit of history.  If you're into drop rides, check out Kennywood's it's not the tallest there is, but you get pretty damn high.  The roller coasters aren't huge and high tech - but they're all solid and in some cases really classic.  The Jackrabbit is one of the classics (a little rough on the spine...), as are the Thunderbolt and the Racer - wheeee!  Phantom's Revenge is a good steel coaster and the Exterminator is a surprisingly fun and wild indoor ride.

The smaller classic rides are so unique and fun!  The Kangaroo makes a hilarious little bouncing sound, the Turtle and the Whip are good old-time fun, the swings are beautiful and the car rides (and bumpers!) are great.

One ride that most people overlook is the one that I have never seen at another park (is there another one out there like this?): the ski lift through the parking lot.

HMQh1eKjGEsN7QLWFgz0ew,vHKcmEp5EyDmDHc1G8MqOg,"Kennywood is a huge part of part of my childhood landscape. (like many other reviewers.) School picnics, high school band nights, date nights, family trips, memories of my grandmother riding the roller coasters with us, my silly brothers, sister and cousins roughhousing and laughing our heads off... all these memories have morphed into current-day new memories with friends and family; nieces and nephews and various other offspring and family. My husband and I got engaged at Kennywood, on a bench near the Pittsburgh Plunge, appropriately enough! 

Many friends who have moved to Pittsburgh from elsewhere have been baffled by ""the locals"" or ""Yinzers"" devotion to this park, complaining that other parks like 6 Flags, Geauga Lake, Hershey Park or Cedar Point are better and worth the drive. I guess it's all about what you want, or what you like. For me, going to Kennywood is almost like going home. I love big, flashy amusement parks with thrilling rides too, but none are like Kennywood to me. I know what I'm going to see at Kennywood. (except when there's a new ride) I know what food is available, I know what characters are going to be bopping around the park for photos, and I know that I won't get cotton candy or fudge till I'm ready to leave, and will happily wait in that endless line at the cart near the gate. I'm ok with all of that. I love it. It's an old park, and along with the newer rides like the Sky Rocket are rides that have been there since we were kids, like the parachutes, the merry go round, the Thunderbolt, Jack Rabbit and Racer, the Kangaroo, Log Jammer and others. I don't expect folks who didn't grow up here to ""get"" it. It's not a big, fancy, flashy park with tons of slick rides. (though there are several.) It's a pretty, family oriented park that is an historic landmark, where some of the happiest hours of my youth were spent, and some of the most fun family days of my adult life as well.

OH, *and*... after the regular season there are now TWO events at Kennywood that you should definitely check out. Phantom Fright Nights is now an established fall event thru Halloween. Along with the scary music, decorations, zombies and other characters waiting to ambush you, and the walk-through haunted ""houses"" and other attractions, expect huge crowds and LONG lines to get on/in any of the rides or attractions.

School picnics, high school band nights, date nights, family trips, memories of my grandmother riding the roller coasters with us, my silly brothers, sister and cousins roughhousing and laughing our heads off... all these memories have morphed into current-day new memories with friends and family; nieces and nephews and various other offspring and family. My husband and I got engaged at Kennywood, on a bench near the Pittsburgh Plunge, appropriately enough! 

Many friends who have moved to Pittsburgh from elsewhere have been baffled by ""the locals"" or ""Yinzers"" devotion to this park, complaining that other parks like 6 Flags, Geauga Lake, Hershey Park or Cedar Point are better and worth the drive. I guess it's all about what you want, or what you like. For me, going to Kennywood is almost like going home. I love big, flashy amusement parks with thrilling rides too, but none are like Kennywood to me. I know what I'm going to see at Kennywood. (except when there's a new ride) I know what food is available, I know what characters are going to be bopping around the park for photos, and I know that I won't get cotton candy or fudge till I'm ready to leave, and will happily wait in that endless line at the cart near the gate. I'm ok with all of that. I love it. It's an old park, and along with the newer rides like the Sky Rocket are rides that have been there since we were kids, like the parachutes, the merry go round, the Thunderbolt, Jack Rabbit and Racer, the Kangaroo, Log Jammer and others. I don't expect folks who didn't grow up here to ""get"" it. It's not a big, fancy, flashy park with tons of slick rides. (though there are several.) It's a pretty, family oriented park that is an historic landmark, where some of the happiest hours of my youth were spent, and some of the most fun family days of my adult life as well.

OH, *and*... after the regular season there are now TWO events at Kennywood that you should definitely check out. Phantom Fright Nights is now an established fall event thru Halloween. Along with the scary music, decorations, zombies and other characters waiting to ambush you, and the walk-through haunted ""houses"" and other attractions, expect huge crowds and LONG lines to get on/in any of the rides or attractions. Still, it's a fun event that has become a tradition in our house. And the newest addition to the Kennywood calendar is the Christmas lights!

I had lots of fun here when I came with a group over memorial day weekend!

1) buy one get one free admission, how do you beat that?!
2) barely any lines, even over the long weekend. Max wait was maybe 20 minutes, shortest was less than 5 min for the big coasters
3) good assortment of rides...They got the fast coasters, the dizzying vomit-inducing rides (not this time though ;)), the bumper cars, etc.
4) unique.. like the Noah's Ark. I was starting to get anxiety having to walk through the moving floors!

One thing, though, is that I wish they had a water park! I'm mostly comparing to King's Dominion in Va, where I usually go. It's nice to cool off in the pool during the hot day~",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,4,6/2/2015,review,0,,"4.5 stars!

There are several classic coasters - The Racer, The Jack Rabbit and The Thunderbolt (my favorite).  The Exterminator, a wacky indoor Wild Mouse coaster is a hoot!  Classic rides such as Music Express, The Whip and The Paratrooper provide nostalgic fun!  The park isn't huge, but they do pack a lot of attractions into a relatively small space.  The new Ghostwood Manor dark ride is a total ""shoot 'em up"" good time!  The classic Noah's  Ark attraction is not to be missed.

The park is clean and well-maintained.  Food options are a step above most amusement parks.  The Parkside Caf?? has some especially good options that are easy on both the taste buds and the wallet.

There are a few disappointments that keep me from doling out more stars though.

The classic Old Mill attraction was recently rehabbed into Garfield's Nightmare - definitely not an improvement.  Cardboard Garfield cut-outs and cheesy 3-D effects do not a fun time make.

The biggest disappointment was the staff.  Aside from the counter girl at the Parkside Caf?? (who was a darling!), most of the staff seemed disinterested and distracted.  While waiting for the Jack Rabbit, we observed on young man working at the photo booth across the way.  He stood with his arms crossed, snapping his chewing gum and paid no attention whatsoever to the guests that approached the booth.  Clearly, he had other places he wanted to be.  While this was the most extreme case, many other staff members were guilty of similar behaviors.  Also, the non-descript ""t-shirt and shorts"" uniforms make the staff blend in with the guests.

Kennywood also needs to work on efficiency.  Rides are loaded VERY slowly and often in a random, haphazard fashion resulting in underutilized capacity despite long lines.  It's no fun waiting only to notice several empty seats once the ride starts.  Other parks are spot-on in this area, so Kennywood should really follow suit.

One big plus is the Night Rider ticket.  For $19.99, you get unlimited rides from 5pm until closing.  A great value!

Kennywood is a great place, but some serious issues need to be addressed.  Once these are handled, Kennywood has the potential to be 5-stars all the way!",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,3,8/12/2009,review,2,,"On the way home from Virginia, my partner and I decided to spend an evening at Kennywood.

UmQuSyo1fjQY1I7UbbVBNQ,cnL7tfuReFAWqS1CUGxF3Q,"Kennywood does a good job of balancing the new with the old, the cutting edge with the historic landmarks. It doesn't compete head on with the shiny mega-corp amusement parks and it doesn't need to. It feels much more laid back than the visits I've had to Six Flags in Atlanta, Ga. 

The landmark classics: The Thunderbolt, The Racers, The Jack Rabbit, the Merry-Go-Round. These are must-see rides. They're oldies but appear well-maintained and are still fun. 

The new(er): Sky Rocket, Phantom's Revenge (one of fastest at 85 mph!) 

Everything seemed pretty clean. Lines at the restrooms weren't too bad. As with any amusement park, I recommend starting early and avoiding the crowds at peak times. 

It's not all roses, mind you. Some rides just need to be gotten rid of: yeah, you Garfield's Nightmare... LAME. And what is up with the skylift between the economy parking lot and the park. It's almost an insult to follow it down into the park looming above (I can't really recall it ever being operational); use it or lose it. Some of the exhibits on the train are the same now as 30 years ago; Change it up! And whose idea was it to add a railing around the Merry Go Round! Well, maybe that cannot be helped to prevent injuries from people jumping on while it is running (I remember doing that and getting yelled at) as well as crowd management. And as with any amusement park, the lines at the rides, ugh. 

I will admit that Kennywood has a special place in my heart being a part of my early formative life. How much so dawned on me during a recent visit this summer with my kids, my cousin and his family. I told my kids how I used to come here when I was little. I used to come with my parents, my cousins and my friends. I remember when the first steel coaster was erected (The Lazer Loop). 

And both of my parents often told me of how they visited here when they were younger. They used to come with their parents, their siblings, and their friends. To my parents, the highlights were the wooden coasters like The Thunderbolt. 

And my maternal Grandmother used to tell me how she visited here when she was younger. She came with her ""fresh off the boat"" from England parents, her siblings, and her friends. By today's standards, it was more a park than amusement park but my Grandmother did talk about the Merry Go Round. 

That's four generations now. 

Granted, Kennywood has changed a lot from what my Grandmother had described, what my my parents had told me, and even what I described to my kids. And I look forward to taking my kids to this park with my summer visits back to Pittsburgh so they can develop their own memories.",1,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,4,8/25/2010,review,2,,"Kennywood does a good job of balancing the new with the old, the cutting edge with the historic landmarks.

It's one of those parks so prevalent in the '20's and '30's yet somehow they were lost to development, economics, etc...but this park is steeped in history. From the monument for George Washington's visit to Fort Dusquene to the train ride which narrates the history of the park, Kennywood has retained it's historical character. 

Not to say it's all shaws and horse drawn buggies! The rides at Kennywood...while not on par with Six Flags or Disney...are fantastic. Many are ones that are originals to the parks, and we took had a few that we had never done before that were neat, historical rides...with the Bobsled one and the Kangaroo coming to mind. The newer rides- Phantom's Revenge and Sky Rocket- are unbelievable. I nearly had an eyeball dislodge on Phantom's Revenge...it's that good. The olden wooden coasters are fantastic in their own rights...Racer must have been the model for Hershey Park's newer ""Racer"" coaster, and neither Jackrabbit, Thunderbolt, or Racer jarred your teeth fillings like Dorney's (Allentown) wooden coasters. The lines were acceptable, even on this ""Fall Festival"" day in August. 

What else stood out? Food was good...decently priced. Parking was free...woo! Employees were friendly, park was clean, and the clientele was well behaved and courteous. 

This park has a strong likeness to our family favorite, Knoebels, of Elysburg, PA. It's family friendly, safe, clean, well landscaped and shaded, and has ties with it's history.

Over the parking lots and into the amusement park!  There is a ride before the rides!!!  (The ski lift stops when it rains... Good to know).

We paid $25.00 each for the night pass (5pm-10pm).  Which was a good deal since we rode tons of rides and ate some funnel cakes.

The place is huge with serious rides!  It seemed like a cross between a sixflags in some parts and a hometown fair in other parts. Long lines but the lines move fast.  Everyone is friendly.  Lots to do of all ages.

Awesome classic wooden coasters mixed with modern and exciting thrill rides. Probably also one of the best values as far as amuesment parks go in the country. 

There are a few knocks on this park though:
~ Food options aren't that great... I find Potato Patch revolting and that is the main food dry of the park. 

~ Lack of good steel coasters. Don't get me wrong Phantom's Revenge is good, but not as good as the original Phantom. I think they should have both because it would have been a nice compliment. 


My solution to the food is either a quick walk outside the park to the McDonalds for cheap eats or the cafeteria that is pretty hidden but it's decent.",0,BacrktTHhhr_LRXCJY_S-w,0,5,8/30/2013,review,0,,"Ahh Kennywood probably the perfect example of how to blend out and new together in perfect harmony.

tlBBPrvSjSsZUZ4HveRB1Q,bDNPrW9Mp1SS_Wb0VahMvg,"Kennywood Fright Night is a must do in the Fall, whether your 14 or 35.  It's a great night of fun, scares and rides.  The layout of the park  is similar to those of normal Kennywood nights.  Some key differences are that some rides are not operating and the appearance of 7 awesome themed haunted houses.  Everyone has a different fear, what's yours?  There is a clown courtyard, a vampire villa, dark shadows, biotech/BioFear,  VooDoo Bayou, Mortem Manor, Kennyville Cemetery, and Gory Park.  My favories were Biotech and Vampire Villa.  Both very well done with great actors and great effects.

The only downside is that the park is usually pretty busy even at 7pm when it opens so you have to be strategic about your haunts.  My group ended up getting the fast track/RIP passes that allows you to get into 4 houses out of the 7 right away and skip the line.  Its 25 dollars a person which is a bit pricey but for us it was worth it.  There are also fast track passes for some rides and the new ride-black widow.  I would say that's the only bad part as the park is only open from 7-1 so its hard to get to everything.  The actors are really into their job so get ready to be scared and surprised.

While waiting in line for a chicken tender meal for our daughter, we watched one of the young girls behind the counter changing her gloves. She took two gloves out of the box and in order to put one on, she tucked the other one under her arm. She put the glove that was going to touch our food in her armpit before putting it on her hand. Immediately following - before we even had chance to walk away - a young man brought out a new tray of pasta. Instead of following proper food safety protocol and removing the old tray, he just dumped the new food in with it. 

Obviously, they shouldn't do these and it shows a lack of training for their young employees. We just wanted to tell a manager about it, and one happened to be around - Mike. When we told Mike what happened, his response was to argue whether or not the pasta thing is an issue (he didn't think the food was old enough to cause a problem - not the point), laugh at us about the glove issue, and walk away. We later went to Guest Services to log a complaint with the supervisor (not knowing that Mike was in charge of the whole operation). He was called up to talk to us and we found out that he'd spent the day with Health Inspector. 

So this person who is supposed to be maintaining food service and safety standards for the entire park laughed at us instead of addressing the complaint or even apologizing. He was completely unprofessional and obviously doesn't know a damn thing about food service - not to mention customer service. 

This was my very first time at Kennywood, being new to Pittsburgh. My husband and his family loved the place when he was growing up, but I can't honestly say we're ever going to be willing to go back. If their management staff isn't properly trained and cares so little about the customer experience, I don't need to spend $40+ a ticket. I can tell you for certain that I'll be logging a complaint with the Health Department and telling everyone I know about this experience.

We were seated in the bar because of a private party, and ended up having a great time. The staff was warm and friendly. The food was incredible. The owner came over several times and chatted up our son, she even gave him a Halloween swag bag.

The french onion soup was really good. A good slab of bread covered in lots of gooey cheese with a rich beef broth. The wedding soup had plenty of meatballs, that were really really good. Our son had a bacon cheeseburger, perfectly cooked with crisp bacon. The chicken quesadilla is large enough to share and filled edge to edge with well seasoned chicken and peppers. The crab stuffed mushroom had a lot of lump crab and very little filler.

Our drinks were always full, and plates cleared promptly. The food was reasonably priced, and not over salted. The restaurant is spotless. The other patrons were really friendly, and everyone chatted back and forth. It was a nice place to hang out for a while.

Folks- if you are down on the North Shore and all the other bars are dead- this one will be packed.  They have a modest sized bar and if the weather co-operates- you can pull up stools to their outdoor bar windows and get served from outside.",0,WjLtEWGvPSIfwMZXUMHX8g,0,5,5/12/2015,review,0,,"HAPPY HOUR...!

I had been staring at the place for months during my walks around the North Shore or heading to a ball game.  There are windows that open up to the outside were they sit people bar style in the warmer months.  It's pretty cool looking and a really great idea.  I was always intrigued, but never able to stop by.  I'm definitely going to choose this place next summer!  But I digress....

We stopped here after a party one night to grab a drink and some snacks.  It's a pretty wide open space to grab a big table for drinks.  Our server came up to us immediately to get us a round of drinks.  The Pumpkin Beer I ordered tasted like Yuengling...a little disappointed, but not the bars fault, just the mysterious brew.  However, the car bomb we ordered tasted delish, so all was forgotten (literally?!).  

I didn't eat any food but what was ordered looked like pretty decent bar food.  I was a little put off by the fact that the ""bucket"" of fish and chips weren't filled completely.  They put a bowl on the bottom and wax paper between to ""fill"" it all the way.  Pretty cheap if you ask me.  

I'm going to go back and get the food....because the atmosphere was decent.

Food sampled included nachos (aka big heaping pile of multi-colored chips w/ very little cheese or other fixins under the top layer), asian shrimp wrap w/ few shrimp, and a cheeseburger w/ cole slaw on the side that wasn't bad but not great either.

Ordered the Rivertowne Pumpkin Ale w cinnamon dusting on the rim and it was really a great tasting beer!! Super delish!!

First off, the enviorment at this place was unreal.  My dad and I came here before going to the Steelers game, and the atmosphere was just excting.  I wanna come here just to watch a game.  While sitting in the stadium I kept thinking back to Rivertowne thinking, ""wow i bet everyone in there is enjoying the game and having a blast together.""  If you cannot get tickets to go to the game, go here and grab some good food and make some new friends.  With that being said, lets move on to the goodies.

The appetizer we got were the Wileys Mushrooms.  I scoped out the menu before coming here, and I knew I was going to order these before I even walked into the front door.  They were excellent.  Cheesy goodness, mixed with some peppers, and of course the delicious mushroom.  Not to mention it was served on a sizzling plate.  It was completely gone within a minute.  

My dad and I split some garlic parmesean wings.  Now I gotta say, I have become a garlic parm connoisseur over the past couple years.  I have to admit these bad boys ranked real high on my top list.  They were not flooded in garlic sauce (this could be a turn off for some people depending on the mood you are in), but I was satisfied with the ""garlicness.""  

Moving onto the main course.  I got the Baja stuffed fish.  This thing was some kind of white fish that was jam packed with crab meat.  It was amazing.  From now on, if i am in the mood for fish, I am going here.  I have no clue what kind of ""white fish"" it was, and I don't care.  It was that good; i promise you.  A little side note was that the veggies that came with it were great too.  I wish I would've gotten the double order that I asked for, but it was no big deal; the place was packed, so you have to expect little mess ups from time to time.

My dad got this burger that had a piece of kielbasi on it.  He loved it.  Right when we left he was already talking about trying to recreate it once we got home.   I did try a bite, and I have to admit it was good.

Like I said this is not only a great place for food, but also a great place to watch the game or just hang out.  Luckily I have one of these right near my house.

Service was underwhelming. It took our waitress some time to greet us initially and to take our order. At one point, we were ready to order our entrees, but she left our table so quickly that we didn't have time to tell her that we were ready. Also, for being a restaurant with a number of alcoholic beverages, our waitress knew very little about what Rivertowne offers. Though a nice girl, I think Rivertowne could invest more time and training in their employees.

I started with a beer and almost made a face when my beverage was brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. I get that Rivertowne is heavily trafficked from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE attendees but that doesn't mean you should be able to both serve beer in a throwaway cup and charge full price.

Finally, the food... meh. I ordered fried fish with potato wedge fries. The fish was OK, but the flavorless wedges required ketchup to be consumed. Plus, I was a little turned off by the dish initially when the man delivering the food stated, ""Here is your catfish."" My catfish?! I definitely didn't order catfish. I questioned him about it, and he just seemed confused.

I started with a beer and almost made a face when my beverage was brought to me in a tiny plastic cup. I get that Rivertowne is heavily trafficked from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE attendees but that doesn't mean you should be able to both serve beer in a throwaway cup and charge full price.

Finally, the food... meh. I ordered fried fish with potato wedge fries. The fish was OK, but the flavorless wedges required ketchup to be consumed. Plus, I was a little turned off by the dish initially when the man delivering the food stated, ""Here is your catfish."" My catfish?! I definitely didn't order catfish. I questioned him about it, and he just seemed confused.

In the future, I would prefer to walk a couple miles to downtown and pay less money for more and better food. I don't plan on returning., nan",2012-10,16,584,"['nKoB5cWZHXYUIUcQsUDogA', 'vGZ7X7ej_TAsyLseZzbOUg', 'u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw', 'Yvn7DHj7o7sSCH2rNH74Mw', 'Enzdhh-rV5JgC4lgg0IdFw', 'sS2sSWqZMnQMRoWx-Mdzgg', '9fTTesCwn9EO-d82ODJAnw', 'sPQ10u9ZsrCVCKhQylFxgQ', 'njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A', 'OD1zfOrexwZoxJjTowGDfw', 'oYTZ2PbYYd2MDbVYUoQpCw', 'ZK3PSm_CwSIW3RYMZJ_g6w', '4ZDskYCgE8VGGRjhcVEx7A', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'gtJJBaQwTwE45NnNF0coVA', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'gwnVSev8aNLvMArs3WTfFw', 'qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA', 'iZC-F_LsIpTYn7PDZCvdrQ', 'r2C9y_0eVE6G80q0GxW8KQ', 'Y1rwDXSNUCWwOS-lmimFnA', 'lhVDU50jg8_WEl-WlKFECg', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', 'o9XGClSBzCsQxbcCzTPdnQ', '3hE4SS0s9-Do1qRDmNulGQ', 'HI7byNVBtzinyLl3UCvynA', 'PyQue3uoOWODLoLULDOPsQ', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', 'dGEAzFX7dZO7pZulTPvIzA', 'CHw1HVGJE0fDY_-5keDKGw', 'drxPEwbovD8HKe80H1YxcQ', 'QQacOXfgNDSwTvJyzB1iLA', 'TN1JWAmCgxlE7v-y04fZmg', 'q4_kY8bBeigYPVS0Ak7QGg', 'qbzoEU-SPiGrmO41giYrcQ', 'rkmM0Ku4NmG6gE5DaaEntA', 'fy8u9MsHxUk1h78r4AlmGg', '2nEF355MJr0-lydkTIKDiA', '7dmRzwPrvtRCvDMS4RJwmw', '--JzqHAkaNejih4O2O9jjw', '5Owl5siqnImojW2u6Fivig', '9HCfCmd0t5GErgm7He6AeQ', 'c3P8lRnyv_beqsg_efD0ew', 'qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ', 'RmabtNbS0Ipfg9N--xnQsw', 'H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg', 's_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw', 'Jc0ifUU7wRjUNA61tjurnA', '4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', 'tbulL35tvViEjm_nbUIE2g', 'MSuyK2p8G9hEqyWf5IgnYQ', 'N1Fh7ob5lQzIiCkiAtxArQ', '4htH8kIpBee8XS8L7Y4E3A', 'u6eVYQExfHDVE1-WJNMeng', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA']",,18,8,14,user,26,24,2,3.76,2,"[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",Elizabeth,347,,126,3,4,624,FALSE,,TRUE,,,,,,,FALSE,TRUE,full_bar,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,,FALSE,"['Pubs', 'Bars', 'American (New)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,,Rivertowne,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,,FALSE,83,,PA,TRUE,,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,"337 N Shore Dr

JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ,NmJIBN4Z_Xj1F86ZHd2Reg,"Before heading to Stage AE Saturday night this was the place to be for a little pregame, pre Snoop cocktail. It was packed upon entering but I managed to land the last seats with the flash of a smile at the gentlemen standing in front of them and a promise to flag down the bartender for refills. The hockey game was on and an excited buzz generated through the room. The doors opened at Stage AE around 7pm but I knew Snoop would not get on stage until later so we had time to chat and have some drinks. The selection on tap was decent and the menu was plentiful. 

We struck up a conversation with the guys who let us sit and they got me even more excited explaining that Snoop does not disappoint but that he would most definitely show up pretty late. This info gave us more time to relax, and snack on a deep fried pretzel with our Guinness pints. Then they started playing some old Snoop Dogg hits to cement the jovial mood of the crowd. All the appetizers coming out of the kitchen looked tasty.

The only incident we had was that our buddies being a little inebriated spilled some vodka soda over my head. It was a trickle of booze and I laughed it off! In true Pittsburghese style the guy in blue plaid apologized profusely and bought us a round. I love Pittsburgh the people are incredibly amiable. Props for not being douches! As we walked over to the concert we left through the back of the building where a huge fire pit was going. I can imagine that in the summer this place will be so much fun! What a great view!

We struck up a conversation with the guys who let us sit and they got me even more excited explaining that Snoop does not disappoint but that he would most definitely show up pretty late. This info gave us more time to relax, and snack on a deep fried pretzel with our Guinness pints. Then they started playing some old Snoop Dogg hits to cement the jovial mood of the crowd. All the appetizers coming out of the kitchen looked tasty.

The only incident we had was that our buddies being a little inebriated spilled some vodka soda over my head. It was a trickle of booze and I laughed it off! In true Pittsburghese style the guy in blue plaid apologized profusely and bought us a round. I love Pittsburgh the people are incredibly amiable. Props for not being douches! As we walked over to the concert we left through the back of the building where a huge fire pit was going. I can imagine that in the summer this place will be so much fun! What a great view! Check out my pics.

Pretty extensive menu but my menu was stained and sticky, and that's a real turn-off for me, losing a star. She ordered a grilled chicken salad, I opted for the cheeseburger. 

She asked for coffee to drink. The server explained there was no coffee made as few people order it. I got a vibe that he was hoping she would order something else, but then he said he would brew some but it would take about 10 minutes. No problem. The coffee arrived but she had to ask for a spoon to stir it with. Then he brought a spoon but it was dirty, so he had to get another one.  I got their IPA draft but it came in a thin, flimsy clear plastic cup. It was so thin that you had to be careful picking it up so you didn't accidentally squeeze it and launch the beer over the rim.  Am I at a college mixer or a sit-down restaurant? Lost a star for that.

My cheeseburger was very good - a nice char on the outside, cooked med-well as I requested and a good beefy taste. The bun was sturdy and stayed intact to the end. My burger came with homemade chips which were on the thick side and crisp - and a large serving as well. She liked her grilled chicken salad which had a nice blend of greens and the dressing was made in-house.

The food arrived in a reasonable period of time, server was friendly, food arrived exactly as we ordered. Prices about what you would expect given the location - our tab was $26 with tax.

57kmdBfFM28OQtJInGciPA,u4Zj0tw48LM_WRCLn8Bkig,"We were already down on the North Shore and it was 90 minutes before the Pirates game, so we decided to grab some dinner. As on our previous visit, we were told 30-35 minutes wait but just 15 minutes later we received the text that our table was ready. 

The server got our drink order promptly after we were seated but it took about 10 minutes for her to bring them. She ordered a lettuce chicken wrap, I opted for fish and chips, substituting cole slaw for the fries.  She said her wrap was quite unimpressive, and my fish - although a nice size serving, was just lousy. Soggy throughout as if it had been soaking in water.

The server got our drink order promptly after we were seated but it took about 10 minutes for her to bring them. She ordered a lettuce chicken wrap, I opted for fish and chips, substituting cole slaw for the fries.

Stopped in on Monday prior to the Pirates home opener for a couple of beverages.  This is not my first time here, but first time since I started Yelping.  The place get can get quite crowded during sporting events or concerts.  There is plenty of indoor seating and some sporadic outdoor seating but it is hard to find.  

While it may be hard to get a seat somewhere or even a beer for that matter, the staff there is absolutely fantastic.  No matter what, hey are always willing to talk beer with you.  Even with a crowd, I was always able to find my waitress.  It is like she knew my beer was empty and knew I was in need of another (all done in moderation of course).

I find that many of the beers at Rivertowne are brewed to style, which makes them quite enjoyable for me.  I don't need a triple hopped, double oaken Hefeweizen. They have a nice selection across various different styles too.  They also carry some select beers that are not Rivertowne beers.  

I have never had food here, so I cannot comment on that, but in perusing the menu it looks like your standard bar fare.  

On nights where there is no game or even is when I find it to be the best.  That is when you can really sit back and enjoy the bar and the wonderful brews.

IcfA3eWFRGxoCYrQyIjicQ,DB0Qj3Lct5W446rX6Z74dQ,"Well i have been here 3 times in the past month. So i got a feel of what the place is like. So the first  time i was there it was packed before a show on Stage AE beers cheap during happy hour.. So we just got beers and drank them outside on the patio. The next night we had another show to go see at Stage AE. Went with other people and got a seat at the bar section. Our waitress Kristen was horrible. You couldnt here her it was like she was in outer space when you talked to her.So we got some apps and beers and left very disapointed. So just last friday i took my mom to the pirate game and thought i would give it one more shot. Bad idea, it was packed but again i was able to find a booth.

So we just got beers and drank them outside on the patio. The next night we had another show to go see at Stage AE. Went with other people and got a seat at the bar section. Our waitress Kristen was horrible. You couldnt here her it was like she was in outer space when you talked to her.So we got some apps and beers and left very disapointed.

XTP1UJ2A37e_VQzqBiJE_Q,_AKjMkWfRnBGbKzNmSf5Gw,"I feel like in the last year - I have had drinks and eats here more then anywhere else in the city.  I really want to give this place 5 stars but there are definitely some areas that need improvement.  

What doesn't need improvement - at least in my opinion - is the food and drink.  The food is bar food but it is well-priced and there is a good amount of diversity on the menu.  I typically order the baked italian sub, the buffalo chicken wrap, and the turkey bacon wedgie (that's right wedgie). The Pizzas also look great but I have never had one.  The draft list is always diverse and I have tried some great new brews here.  This is a great place to watch any type of sporting event and they have a pretty decent happy hour as well - although sometimes you have to remind the servers what the specials are.  

This brings me to what prevents me from giving this place 5 stars - the service and the atmosphere.  First the service - I have had great experiences with the service and also experiences that are sub-par.  First - the waitresses are usually very nice but they neglect to write things down and food will come out incorrectly.  I am not one to send things back but this has happened more than once.  Also they are always willing to split up checks - which is very much appreciated but they seldom split them up correctly (because they don't write anything down).  The ladies at the host stand are sometimes miserable but almost always don't know what you are talking about when you let them know that you already checked-in with NoWait.  Finally, Rivertowne brings in the most annoying DJ  that plays awful music on Pirates Game Days.  This is completely not necessary - especially since there is a digital jukebox here.  Rather then be something that its not with the DJ - I just wish Rivertowne would play on its strengths and be a cool and funky sports bar with good food and drinks.

Despite its shortcomings - unless something better opens up in the Northside I will likely keep coming back.",0,WjLtEWGvPSIfwMZXUMHX8g,0,4,8/12/2014,review,0,,"I feel like in the last year - I have had drinks and eats here more then anywhere else in the city.

Uotsuwx2h4c3iJA4bzp1DA,d6aLIlO7OKr-7KHG4MilKA,"I am not from Pittsburgh but travel there often for sporting events and concerts, and I have always had a great experience at Rivertowne despite it being usually crowded. ( The bar is right across from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE) I have to say three things, largely in response to other reviews I have read...

One, this is a sports bar. If you are ordering appetizers, pizza, wings, etc. I dont think you can go wrong. I cannot attest to how the tuna is, because this is a sports' bar.

( The bar is right across from Heinz Field, PNC Park, and Stage AE) I have to say three things, largely in response to other reviews I have read...

One, this is a sports bar. If you are ordering appetizers, pizza, wings, etc. I dont think you can go wrong. I cannot attest to how the tuna is, because this is a sports' bar. I wouldn't order it here, nor would I go to a Mexican restaurant and order a cheeseburger. The buffalo chicken dip is as good as buf chic dip can be.

4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ,PwaVD3LMEgFsqM-4_CNjDg,"If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.  A locals favorite they've seen a lot of growth since I started going 10 years ago.   They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.  

My favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.  

I've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints.",0,1qCuOcks5HRv67OHovAVpg,0,5,3/21/2015,review,1,,"If you want to know the people from Homestead/Munhall then Dukes is the place for you.

XeiKNx2LOdHWGILzgaybnA,csbPKLai10nWYfvig4pdzQ,"I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.

They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome. 

It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. 

The biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. 
Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.

Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles, beef and spaghetti sauce.  I guess you can't believe everything your parents tell you right?  

So going in here, I was thinking, great...mom's goulash!  What was set in front me looked NOTHING like what I was used to.  It was a mish mosh of veggies,noodles, gravy and some random unidentifiable food items.  I usually eat whatever is put in front of me, so I wasn't scared to dive it.  Sadly, I just didn't like it.  I thought it was actually not very appetizing at all.  I know, I know, this is like ""world famous"" goulash, but I was NOT into it!  

What I was into was the German Potato Salad.  I love it, and honestly, I feel like I never get the same version of it anywhere in the Burgh.  This was a no frills version, with scallop sliced potatoes and a thick vinegar sauce.  Maybe a bit too much, but not enough for me to eat it all!  

Would I go back? If someone else really wanted to go there, but I wouldn't suggest it nor would I go on my own.

I really had no clue what they offered for brunch options, but quickly learned they have a a pretty decent size brunch buffet.  I'm not below buffets at all, it's the fat kid in me!  Most things still looked a little questionable to me, but I went for the big ticket items.  Make your own omelets, potato pancakes and dessert.  I'd hit up the buffet again, but still be hasty to check out the regular menu again.  

The omelet was made right in front of you, so I added cheese, mushrooms, peppers, tomatoes and onions.  I was super excited about it because it was the size of a football.  Sadly, it was pretty tasteless.  I don't think they added any salt or pepper to the egg mix, so it came out really bland, despite loading up on ingredients.  

But the potato pancakes... I could survive on them forever.  They were amazeballs!  Add some sour cream and I was in potato patch heaven!  I had to keep myself from getting more because of the other thing I loaded up on... dessert.  

The desserts looked unassuming, but they were also awesome.  I had a smattering of delectable bites.  The scones were so moist and tasty.  I had to stop myself from taking more than 20.  I also had some carrot cake, brownies, cookies among other things I inhaled and didn't pay attention too.  Should I be embarrassed?  Probably.

9Ify25DK87s5_u2EhK0_Rg,aeZvQwzxFcBFVYEo31WGxA,"Max's is a great place for German food.  I've had several sandwiches, most of the appetizers and even the Sunday brunch (which has a good spread but can be hit or miss) -  though not all in one visit.

I most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.

All together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.  If you want German food in Pittsburgh, Max's is definitely the place to start.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,4,6/10/2012,review,0,,"Max's is a great place for German food.

I most recently took my Mom out for dinner using a Living Social deal I had.  Somehow, even though we have both been to Max's quite a few times before neither of us had ever seen the sampler platter option on their menu.  For just a bit more than the cost of the regular entrees, you can choose three entrees and two sides.  Obviously the portions of each selection are smaller than the individual meals, but the size is still generous and there were only a couple things not available for the sampler platter.  Between the two of us we selected six different items and four different sides to try and shared everything - and still had enough left for a full meal each the next day.  I can't even decide on my favorite of all the items we tried.  If you aren't sure about some of the entrees, this is a great way to see what you like.  I personally loved everything so much that I think my new go-to menu item from now on will be the sampler platter.  Not being forced to choose just one item is what living in America is all about.

All together I think our bill was around $35 (no alcoholic beverages consumed).  Some might consider this a tad pricey but the food is so good I usually don't mind the slightly higher cost.  Service has never been a problem for me in fact they've always been helpful when I have questions about the menu.  Full bar with numerous good beers on tap.

The red cabbage here is amazing, and the pretzel was fairly good with a honey mustard dipping sauce...but I guess its kind of hard to mess up something thrown into a deep fryer and stuffed with cheese.

Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,k9lh3a3yUZy0heXsfxPR_Q,"After hearing Hofbrauhaus-haters say that Max's Allegheny Tavern is the only place to go in Pittsburgh for German food, my husband and I decided to finally try the restaurant this afternoon.

We were seated in little booths right next to the bar. They were cozy, but the seats reminded me of old fashioned church pews. Our waitress soon brought us a little basket of four rolls with butter, sauerkraut relish, and apple butter. Though I liked the different varieties of bread, it was nothing special. The relish and apple butter were a nice touch though.

Our waitress was busy with both waiting tables and tending the bar, but she managed to check on us pretty frequently. Our food also came out relatively promptly. I order the Wiener Schnitzel with Potato Pancakes and Spatzle on the side. The Wiener Schnitzel was amazing -- by far the best I've ever had! The veal was tender and the fried surface was perfectly crispy. However, the sides sadly did not match this main dish. The Potato Pancakes were oddly bitter, and I did not enjoy them with either the sour cream or applesauce. I only ate two or three bites and completely stopped eating them. (I must add that Hofbrauhaus's potato pancakes are delicious and something that I order every time that I go there.) I also did not enjoy the Spatzle, but I am accustomed to eating cheese Spatzle.... So I may be reviewing this harshly since I'm just not used to plain Spatzle, but in my opinion, it was terribly bland and watery.

Overall, Max's Allegheny Tavern served one incredible item (Wiener Schnitzel), but everything else was merely mediocre.

The omelet station is standard (no egg whites for you health-nuts) and heavenly pastries will always await you along with potato pancakes.  I'm not in love with their potato pancakes, but being that Max's specializes in German food, you've got to try at least one with their homemade applesauce.

Some of my rotating favorites on the buffet include red cabbage, Eggs Benedict, and the Farmer's Breakfast.  You can order off the menu during brunch if you aren't in mood to gorge yourself on the buffet.  No drinks included with the buffet :( but you can order them, of course.

I love the decor at Max's - it's an old house, and much of the furniture looks like it was in this house and just remained when it converted to a restaurant.  Max's location in Old Deutschtown on the North Side fits it perfectly.  They even offer a shuttle to Heinz Field on Steeler game days (small fee applies).",1,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,3,12/11/2013,review,2,,"Brunch, brunch, brunch.

JEvkfVPf_DuhX-ntE5L6bQ,h6zmfYIgQXJIYYH4t0gwKA,"After a long day at work I met up with a friend for some German fair on the northside. I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy, and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. ""Dirty pipes"" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.

We both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef.

I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy, and topped with fried onions. They also had a side of french onion sour cream. Pretty tasty stuff! Plus they gave you so many I could have filled up just on the app. I ordered the Bell's Oberon while my dining partner ordered the sampler. I have to say that she wasn't that impressed with the brew. ""Dirty pipes"" and I quote. I had the same taste from my order so I focused on the food.

We both ended up ordering Max's Goulash that was suggested by another Yelper! You can't go wrong when you have that recommendation. This is not our small town neighborhood goulash made from egg noodles and a mix with ground beef.

Listen I grew up a kleine Madchen in Stuttgart Germany.  I know my German food, and if you are thinking Hoffbrau Haus you are thinking of just one type of german cuisine.  Aside from when Atria's has their Oktoberfest menu, this IS the most authentic German food in Pittsburgh.

How good is Max's?

It was good enough my German family and I held my sister's rehearsal dinner there.  And they even let us have Polter Abend on the sidewalk outside!  

It is good enough we take our father there for Father's Day.

BTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.

In fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????

I'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.

For the past two years, every time we come here we say, ""This just isn't as good as I remember.""  For starters, the food is always served cold.  Don't believe me?  I hope you enjoy tepid knackwurst and cold mashed potatoes.

BTW, to whoever makes their mashed potatoes, you have to boil the potatoes before you mash them.  Yesterday they were undercooked, gritty, and gross.

In fact, all of the food is becoming gross.  My friend got the roasted beef and what came out looked like a cold cut covered with a congealed beef gravy that had bits of carrots in it.  wtf was that????

I'm done.  This place has gone down hill.  You need a new chef, immediately.  Max's is a North Side institution but there are so many new, better restaurants opening up that they really need to up their game.

PS--thanks for the nausea and hurling about 6 hours after dinner., nan",2012-06,25,250,"['UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ', 'WJNMh_hUymOX7CDKtCOKUA', 'u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw', 'LhgQq1x4n9ardg1PFo8vgg', 'dapbOj1WwSchUr-7V63IBg', 'Rg4gzsz3w00vRlIOXcGUIA', 'Yvn7DHj7o7sSCH2rNH74Mw', '88_PacBkt-EaSgW3kzimkg', 'nxkHZn3afvqkRX8TJ4TvKw', 'a92UhSg9_xhZYOEKxfbtMQ', 'u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'F5H9Zui--2A5fd3ZEMxvOQ', 'pzhWDH7rdPndaJeQX8X-8A', 'yj_H9BUxDPdZy55huaevOQ', '-0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA', 'qcJ4bE0d-5T-Tfq813NduA', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'qaMsP2zsLnelcd4Hj60TmA', 'Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w', 'Z-TW_TppnxT4TkFeavNaQw', '7Htz0ueuNudnTHRKldwWIw', 'viVpKuhCMq344B0UqrdZqg', 'J_q8jN623uew8ZzMChXBCA', '-LXOoP1lkinLgwrmx_WY9g', '2DsyRzWnwmf22gL5jwbwiw', '8IjVESbd_bQcPN_AIAY5hw', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', 'FKosz9ExVLhsrITQk5xl4g', 'L_Xi7cNe1heZd5hfQE_gQQ', 'dnYS5JRUt7qdeSb9yh3dkw', '68vjXoLMogT5p1jb8enlVQ', 'FNGhSvqmoGHPvCTcia8RPQ', 'fy8u9MsHxUk1h78r4AlmGg', 'yl3VWypD3MiZyYRXOnmg2w', 'qXwv7qmDAGPYPtpi53Kl6A', '3HQ8d8TvFOhGcStjP9N9bg', 'E62SZVU_FsbCYaVnMRs4TA', '-c9vriPwIK7quRUwxFdAzw', 'uMvaxSdoRkDmgknGnQZj2w', 'bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw', 'p8z32LHEzVlrY42oS4la_A', '2rSeth60_CuWN3ZJ4k41lg', 'xpvpJB3DArM9zhb10Z1rvg', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 'avKXNLxVjihEjWkyNfI6sg', '4vynExs_j1wuiiiHa8jnTQ', 'Pna2DDMVN7gF8Ll_VKbU9Q', 'a0ULPTNi05w-BNVovVUz2w', 'Nrkkg0nH8o06R29k7eWsSA', 'eGtZWzsfJ8XWVDKhnKAiCw', 'WRp42h00SZYThuZuFW8KXQ', 'q7EsUjiiemZj9zSWaykVxg', 'UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA', 'fc0zgJ2Etjc12gxFwWHjYA', '4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ', 'byglvAgxmuCpCeSVp_R2_Q', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', '2BYGvFAgV87LgIk4EqLtwg', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA']",,27,13,21,user,22,34,1,3.47,4,"[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",Kristen,315,,456,1,35,678,FALSE,,TRUE,11:00,,,,,11:00,FALSE,FALSE,full_bar,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,11:00,FALSE,"['German', 'Pubs', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,11:00,Max's Allegheny Tavern,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,,TRUE,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,140,,PA,TRUE,23:00,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"537 Suismon St

SVd6Re9tpabo413b4LghYw,3xdZl1rxlH3wSweUAgpL4g,"I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually, it's the best German food I've had outside of Germany, and I've definitely had worse meals in Germany as well.

Max's is in a restored hotel, and the decor is very much in the Victorian style of the original hotel building.  The exception is the bar area that's good for happy hour or watching a game, or just having a beer -- that has a lot of neon and a jukebox.  But the bar area is also tasteful and pleasant to be in.  Max's has a full bar, but their real specialty is their excellent selection of German beers, both in bottles and on tap.

I haven't met a wurst I didn't like, and they're pretty much all offered here.  The Braunschweiger sandwich is pretty delicious and unique in my experience, and the schnitzels are very delicious as well.  Another specialty is the kase spatzle (Spatzle noodles with smoked Gouda cheese -- a twist on mac and cheese that ensures that even a picky child will have something to enjoy here), but my two favorite menu picks here are the hassenpfeffer and the spinach salad with warm bacon dressing.  For sides, the red cabbage salad is my favorite, although the sauerkraut is also very good.  I don't care for the German potato salad, however -- I like the kind that has caraway seeds and vinegar, and is served cold, but Max's offers the kind that has an unidentifiable sauce and is served warm.  Some people like that style of potato salad though, and from what I can tell, Max's does a decent rendition of it.

If you're looking to reserve a room here for a banquet, you have a lot of options.  The basement ""Rathskellar"" is more bar-like in its atmosphere.  It would be a good place for some guys to have a birthday party or something.  For a rehearsal dinner or other formal event, one of the upstairs banquet rooms would be better.  Depending on the size of your group, you can arrange to have a buffet-style dinner, or individuals in the group can order directly off the regular dinner menu.",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,5,1/20/2009,review,1,,"I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.

As for the food... well, you can't find much better German food than this and at this price!  Both of my parents favor the peasant platter.

Everything is made in house, which is enough to win me over. We started with the sausage and cheese plate, paired with the bread basket. Homemade honey mustard, gouda, Swiss, and the best kielbasa we've ever had the pleasure to bite into. Just as we're polishing off our plate and rubbing our full stomachs, our entrees came. 

The schnitzel was to die for, as was the rabbit, both smothered in homemade mushroom gravy. The sauerkraut was a perfect combination of savory and acidic. The potato pancakes topped with homemade applesauce and some sour cream were just... Wow. 

I would definitely recommend getting the beer sampler, awesome deal and a great way to try all of their German beers without going overboard.

bhZ13wN_5lQrKX278AP_aw,IVLvOyds9KrxGIuAY2tcsg,"I have been coming to Max Allegheny Tavern since I was still in my mother's womb.  But seriously.  This place has been an institution for my family, and I really love it here.  I feel like this is some of the only German food in Pittsburgh, and I think it represents fairly well.  My thoughts:

Brunch Buffet- I love the Sunday brunch buffet more than life.  Omelette station, German and American breakfast and lunch foods, and lots and lots of beautiful, delicious, and decadent desserts.  It's heaven on Earth.  There is usually a decent selection of meats, and the potato pancakes are almost always featured.  They've changed it a bit over the years, but I still love this buffet.

Appetizers- My family loves the soft pretzels.  They are so yummy and buttery, but a bit heavy if you are going to eat your entire meal.  So make sure to share.

Meals-  I, personally, have never had a bad meal here.  The sauasages of all varieties have been great.  The weinerschnitzel also great.  Sandwiches all good as well.  I really like the cheesy spaetzle dish that is just like macaroni and cheese but with spaetzle noodles!  I don't get too crazy and order anything complicated, though.

Sides-  I love love love their sides.  I could live on the spaetzle and potato pancakes.  Don't pass the sides up!

Dessert:  Also love their desserts.  There is a chocolate chocolate cake that they heat up with homemade whipped cream that is TO DIE FOR.  Not so shockingly, the apple strudel is wonderful as well.

Besides the food, the servers are always very friendly and efficient.  There is also ample street parking, which is really nice.

jO1pSCw0tv-IyimtVFtPpA,yM4tNnuNuiH7MU54Ul128Q,"After feeling ""crowded out"" by the throngs of people converging upon Downtown and the North Shore for the Three Rivers Arts Festival this past Sunday we decided to venture a bit deeper into the North Side and give Max's Allegheny Tavern a whirl. My partner has been in the basement before for various work-related functions, but I had never been there, despite driving by on numerous occasions. 

    We easily found on-street parking and entered the restaurant. I immediately loved the decor in the entry room/bar area, and those pleasant furnishings continued into the more intimate rear room where we were seated. We enjoyed the beautiful wall tapestries, and I thought the old newspaper-like menus were pretty cool! I was surprised (in a good way) at the old-fashioned urinals in the men's room. In a city that has struggled to nourish and revitalize its history over the years I was already a fan of how unique Max's was in the regard of feeling ""authentic"" in an era of predictable chains.

     We were initially enticed by the prospect of ordering fried soft pretzels stuffed with cheese as a shared appetizer only to find out they were not available. We settled for the non-cheese-stuffed version, which were ""melt in your mouth"" good and were handsomely complemented by tangy honey mustard. We were a bit dehydrated after walking miles around the city, yet our waitress was very attentive in consistently replenishing our water glasses as soon as they were half-empty. I was craving a burger but was tempted instead by the fried fish sandwich, which I ordered with a side of potato pancakes and applesauce. My partner ordered a fried chicken sandwich with the same side I did. 

    Our food arrived surprisingly promptly. My fish sandwich was HUGE! I had enough to take home and enjoy for a post-work meal the following evening. The fish tasted fresh, although I wasn't a fan of having to pick small bones out of my mouth in exchange for enjoying that freshness. The bread it was served upon was tasty as well. The potato pancakes were thick, fresh, and were delicious when enjoyed with the chunky applesauce. My partner also thoroughly enjoyed his own sandwich. 

    As if this wasn't good enough our check was only $22! We will definitely be back soon, at which point I look forward to trying a burger!",0,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,0,4,6/11/2013,review,3,,"After feeling ""crowded out"" by the throngs of people converging upon Downtown and the North Shore for the Three Rivers Arts Festival this past Sunday we decided to venture a bit deeper into the North Side and give Max's Allegheny Tavern a whirl.

This north side German food institution in Pittsburgh has been around for years and years and has menus that tell you so. They also tell you the story of the north side of Pittsburgh, which I also found interesting. The place itself has a lot of character and looks like it's seen a lot of years there. It's a little weathered, but definitely homey and sturdy.

Randy S. and I headed there post Tazza D'Oro on a Sunday for brunch. It happened to be the same very Sunday the Pens were playing the Flyers in game 7, so all the waitresses were wearing Pens paraphernalia, which definitely added to the experience. On Sunday morning it has a brunch buffet with all the standards, plus a healthy dose of Germanic add ons like German farmers breakfast (eggs, sausage and gravy-ed potatoes), red cabbage, pork chops, sauerkraut and potato pancakes. 

The brunch buffet is in a room with a giant tapestry of Neuschwanstein behind the guys at the omelet bar. If that's not rad, I don't know what is. We told the waitress we were going in, went and got back and sat down to find our two ice teas on the table in mason jars (always dope). 

The food was just what you would expect in Pittsburgh: gut busting. It wasn't artisinal or fancy, healthy or particularly remarkable, but it was pretty fonking good and to eat that food in that restaurant really made me feel like I was in Pittsburgh. I can imagine all the food there would be of the 'hot and brown' category, in a positive way. And the waitress was probably the nicest on our drive from Dallas to CT.

As for the environment, the restaurant is housed in what looks like what might of used to be a house back in the day. It had lots of little dining rooms. The decor was kind of outdated, but I think that's what you'd expect and it's part of the charm. The tables were spaced a little too close for my liking, but it was tolerable. 

Overall, I'd go back if invited, but I don't know if I'd go again on my own., nan",2012-09,3,123,"['u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw', 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw', '7ds_u0wxzQoHoWcaNlJllQ', 'KpOVBdN4qnEa5ghu_t7TYQ', 'njgEC3foXamFUQxsTBeY5A', 'Abrkd94L1fFs1Xgcp7MAbQ', 'SfrDwnQpTWNs0R-oewFn4A', '_VL6utGEEQiH45dO7YdJNQ', 'DJEMTgcPO5O6qQA1eWNLSw', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ', 'hfOq42TDAe5wYeytQeNSKg', 'Y1rwDXSNUCWwOS-lmimFnA', '6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA', 'xs38HKO_nNQJt1EJTD8IEA', 'PS-2Pn9HsmASUmfmtSyx0g', 'rGuk1S7MIU8M9ZE2mulVsg', '3hE4SS0s9-Do1qRDmNulGQ', 'CHw1HVGJE0fDY_-5keDKGw', 'QQacOXfgNDSwTvJyzB1iLA', 'lAqoz5QTFxp3GDfpq0McRQ', 'FNGhSvqmoGHPvCTcia8RPQ', 'eK6xq1LWBlbeqaObP39_0w', 'WL8_Xlo-WIrFmTnolm006Q', 'DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg', 'XDaKOk6lgYf2NSKNcsAltg', 'qnxh-3mYWWPN_k6OkmSJiQ', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 'adM9JzC8_MEdhmfgqoXe2Q', 'Mc2x2peYqbks_e1SisNc7g', 'F74ZfDfeP78nLsCpllnvmg', '4N4SJ98YMkxdHmMHAkpV2g', 'xHDuNWPNO_2R2nlQ4w10BA', '0xOsp4vL3UIG4G9eJ4MEGA', 'N1Fh7ob5lQzIiCkiAtxArQ']",,9,5,4,user,11,11,,3.92,2,"[2013, 2014, 2015]",Elizabeth,64,,31,,1,159,FALSE,,TRUE,11:00,,,,,11:00,FALSE,FALSE,full_bar,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,11:00,FALSE,"['German', 'Pubs', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,11:00,Max's Allegheny Tavern,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,,TRUE,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,140,,PA,TRUE,23:00,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"537 Suismon St

sYonLXU0zgZGGaRDJRPxXw,nVVl8xL4CIQfIygXnzvhGQ,"Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life, I've somehow managed to never eat at Max's Allegheny Tavern until recently.  

My initial impression of the restaurant was positive - the place had an old neighborhood feel to it, a small crowd was drinking at the end of the antique hardwood bar, and the German murals on the walls made me crave an icy-cold German lager with a stout head of foam.  I thought about how well German potato salad would taste with that beer.  So I grabbed a seat at the bar and eagerly awaited the first taste of my beer.

And I waited...and waited...and waited some more - for over 15 minutes before someone came around to take the order.  Actually that isn't quite accurate.  Two employees came around - one to the end of the bar, and one behind the bar directly opposite me.  Both of them stared at me.  Neither one greeted me or asked me what I would have like to order.  I stared back, incredulously, and even made a ""what's going on here"" palms-extended-upward-shoulder-shrug gesture.  Neither one took the hint.

Finally a third employee came around the bar and took my order.  Great, I thought to myself, finally that beer.  She served the beer in a Mason jar.  WTF?!?  Who serves imported German lager at a German restaurant in a freaking Mason jar?  Max's does.  The beer was devoid of its head, likely the result of a bad beer pour and/or a less than perfectly clean glass (an endemic problem with Pittsburgh restaurants, in my observation).  I was sad.  I quaffed my beer quickly in an attempt to salve my irritation and opened the menu.

My first impression of the menu can be summed as follows: ""Uh-oh"".  The menu is huge with a number of ""slow-food"" stews and braises.  The restaurant is more than half-empty.  How can a restaurant prepare such a large number of menu items, including more than a few labor-intensive dishes, freshly every day and still stay in business when the place isn't even half-full?  Answer: They can't.  The food isn't fresh.

I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel.  I love properly prepared Wiener Schnitzel.  Made with fresh butterflied veal breast, slightly pounded and seasoned, well-coated in fresh bread crumbs, and pan-fried in clarified butter until golden brown on the outside and juicy on the inside, Wiener Schnitzel is the ultimate comfort food.  

Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.

My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The ""bacon"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, ""meat"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  

Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, ""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service"".

That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.

If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.

Sadly, Max's Wiener Schnitzel had nothing to do with properly prepared Schnitzel.  The veal was super-thin, had a texture that strongly suggested it had been mechanically processed, and tasted as if it was pre-breaded and frozen.  It wasn't pan fried either.  The breaded, frozen, puck was simply dropped into a fryolater - where the breading puffed out and fell off of the meat in places (which doesn't happen when the cutlet is resting against the cooking surface under its own weight as when the dish is properly pan-fried).  The edges of the sad Schnitzel had curled up and it looked a horrible mess on the plate.  Curly Schnitzel?!?  My stomach dropped.

My sides, German potato salad and braised red cabbage, were equally awful.  The German potato salad had an unnatural glossy sheen - the kind that typically comes from bottled sauces that contain high fructose corn syrup.  The ""bacon"" in the dressing was nothing more than tiny flecks of some sort of processed, possibly faux, ""meat"".  The potatoes were suspiciously uniform in thickness and roundness - exactly the homogeneity that is found in pre-peeled, pre-sliced, vacuum-sealed processed potatoes.  It was a gluey, sickly sweet, mess.  I didn't have more than a bite or two.  The braised red cabbage didn't taste fresh - it tasted like it had been sitting in a steam table for a day or two and my order was its last chance to be eaten.  

Max's Allegheny Tavern bills itself on their web site as, ""The Best in German Fare.  The Best in Service"".

That's total bullshit.  It's awful - both for service and fare.

If you want good, authentic, German fare (in which the Schnitzel is properly pan-fried to order and delicious), join the Teutonia Mannerchor down the street.

5E3eBSKdIJNjnKp-_RrQsQ,q9EUL-Kxv8tkKGx24AcgTQ,"Greatest place in Pittsburgh for German food!!

My favorite dinner here is Max's Goulash.  Its a great beef stew with spaetzle and you can get potato pancakes on the side.  The potato pancakes are, without a doubt, the best in Pittsburgh!!

While the food is fantastic, the staff and customer service is what keeps this place from being really excellent.  Its a very ""come as you are"" sort of place and rightfully so as it's a tavern/restaurant but the staff may take the casual nature of the restaurant a little too seriously.

One evening about a year ago, I went in for dinner.  I originally thought to sit at a wooden booth in the bar and there was only 1 open, the last towards the back.  I sat down and the seat completely collapsed on me!  I'm far from what you'd call ""fat"" ""heavy set"" or even a ""big girl"" and the staff just sort of stared at me as though it were my fault that their booth just fell apart, the bartender even laughed at me while I tried to get up.  No one asked if I was ok, no one asked if I needed help and I was generally ignored as I tried to pull myself to my feet.

*I* had to approach the hostess, tell her that the booth had just collapsed and ask to be reseated.  She rolled her eyes at me and told me the dining room was full so I'd have to wait.  

Ok, understandable... could you offer a drink or a manager or something while I waited considering the fact that your booth just broke apart?

The entire incident was either completely ignored by staff, like it never happened or I was looked at like it was my fault.  I didn't even get so much as an apology!

I've been back a couple of times since then because the food is always good but I always sit in the dining room now which is sort of a shame because I actually like the bar atmosphere better.  

Luckily for me though, their menu is online and they offer take out.  Unfortunately, they have the hostess answering those phone calls and since she's not a server, she doesn't have a lot of knowledge about the menu.  When I asked for a total, I was put on hold for a couple of minutes.  She finally came back and I asked how long and was put on hold again so she could go ask the kitchen.  She was quite rude about it, like I was bothering her.

Bottom line: Max's *is* the best place for German food in Pittsburgh, hands down.  But, the food is the only thing you're going for.  The staff could use some help on customer service.",1,IxQ1ATP_Wg_QujO9nywzcQ,1,3,4/6/2011,review,0,,"Greatest place in Pittsburgh for German food!!

Where most people associate Hofbrauhaus with the ultimate German beer-hall experience, I prefer Max's for the quieter, less raucous environs. (At least when it's not Oktoberfest)

We'd been there once before and immediately fell in love with the place. I (still) keep raving about the Sausage and Cheese platter. They've got some good Gouda. The Potato Pockets (pierogies) were OK -- I'd take some Pierogies Plus or Forgotten Taste over Max's, but that's just me.

The spaetzel was to die for, however. It's like a German Mac n' Cheese. And boy, do I love me some Mac n' Cheese. It literally melts in your mouth with its' ooey-gooey-ness.

Drink-wise, I tried their German lager and Thom tried the sampler. Thom is a beer enthusiast. For around eight bucks, you get a GOOD amount of beers to try -- they are not some dinky little shot glass samples, either. Thom had some trouble near the end finishing it...it was so much beer. Bob had a Captain and ginger-ale...in a king-size goblet. Goblets are the ONLY way to serve adult bevvies.

For dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.

We finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.

Our visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign.

For dinner, I had the pork loin over an apple-raisin gravy/bread concoction. The pork loin was flavorful and tender, and quite delicious. Sara had the sauerbraten and seemed to enjoy it. Bob's burger was ginormous and looked extra tasty.

We finished it off with the Apple Fritters. Now, these fritters aren't for the faint of heart. And they aren't your average dinky small sized portions, either. You get two huge deep fried apple fritters, covered in vanilla ice cream. One person CANNOT eat the whole serving. You must, I repeat MUST share them. If you attempt to eat the whole plate yourself, you will have flavor explosion, followed by severe heartburn. But damn, are they GOOD.

Our visit ended up totaling 2 hours. One thing, though...please fix your outdoor sign. Usually it shines out like a red and blue beacon in the night for people to find their way there, but on Wednesday, it was out. Driving there, I got confused on where it exactly was (but I had a general idea, as I had been there before.)., nan",2011-11,1,9,"['4q3czSXkHBPkW21RdzpJ2A', 'zJq2g6Rcki1Zx8i2Fbpo0Q', 'LI1aIB7vZqaYR6IWiYvLIw', 'f5I3Que-1U4F6fPL3FQuRg']",,1,0,1,user,,3,,4.7,,[],Michele,4,,2,,,12,FALSE,,TRUE,11:00,,,,,11:00,FALSE,FALSE,full_bar,FALSE,,FALSE,FALSE,,11:00,FALSE,"['German', 'Pubs', 'Bars', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,11:00,Max's Allegheny Tavern,TRUE,FALSE,,,FALSE,,TRUE,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,140,,PA,TRUE,23:00,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"537 Suismon St

I have had this made for me by real German cooks so I have a good idea what it's supposed to taste like and this isn't it. It was made from pork instead of beef with frozen peas and carrots. The gravy wasn't a rich and savory, it was canned or packaged with I don't even know what spices in it. When I complained to the waitress she said that most people don't like it either. She asked me if I wanted something else but I was in a hurry and ate the meat after I scraped the gravy off of it. I have been to this place 1 or 2 times a year and I have had undercooked potato pancakes, greasy rubins and cold sausages.

yzUm9CgzEt_5kZ5nStS7yw,gHKXQT4xVWohNGkCR6swog,"Why you should trust my review: I am German. I've been to Germany. I LOVE German food. And German beer. 

The bar is awesome. Wish we had more time just to chill and drink. But our waitress was awesome, attentive and knowledgeable! Order a REAL beer. Something on tap from Germany. (If not, I'll give you dirty looks from behind my coffee cup.)

What you should order: The Sampler Platter. Pick three amazing entrees, two awesome sides. Brilliant for $16.95... best deal on the menu. And if they have a meatball appetizer you want this. You do. 

So which entrees: 
 - Schnitzel. Whichever one you're drooling over. Personally Jager Schnitzel is always best because God blessed the world when he made mushrooms, and man praised God by making mushroom sauce.
 - Leberkase. Wow. This was fantastic. It's like a cross between liverwurst (but NOT made with liver) and a meatloaf. Fantastisch.
 - Weisswurst. It was good. I've had better and yes I know its a German faux pas to have weisswurst at any other time of day than a midmorning snack... however. it was still yummy and I happily moaned with each bite i consumed with mustard.

So which sides: 
 - Spaetzle! Buttery goodness. Never had it or heard of it? Think little dumplings. In butter. Es ist wunderbar.
 - Sauerkraut... they make theirs with sausage. what?! Ja... mmmmm.
 - Potato Pancakes. You order these with applesauce. you hear me? applesauce.

What to avoid... that's pretty harsh but they lost a star for a reason:
 - German Potato Salad was too sweet and soupy. My great grandma's recipe puts this to shame.
 - IF you don't like mustard (weirdo) the Sauerbraten has a mustard sauce. I like it, but others don't. You've been warned.

We walked here from the ballpark... took about 15 minutes. Worth the walk both ways and they treated us well despite me wearing a Cardinals shirt in a foreign land.

We tried the sausage and cheese sampler appetizer and it was simplicity at it's finest - fresh, delicious sausage, rich cheeses, and an excellent mustard for dipping. I was really impressed with how such a simple appetizer could convey the quality of their food so well. Delicious!

The entrees were equally as tasty. I tried a turkey reuben which came on a potato pancake. Obviously, this particular entree was not the most traditional German faire, but, once you took a bite, there was no going back. A variety of sides were available; I tried the spaetzle - also very simple, but delicious.

Overall, this is a great place - cozy vibe, excellent German food (both traditional and more adventurous), and quick, friendly service.

Now I'm not Peruvian and don't pretend to be an expert; however, I was somewhat recently in Peru for 10 days, including a few locations far from Lima. I also have a Peruvian sister-in-law, so I've tried homemade and authentic restaurant-style Peruvian food. 

None of the food here even sound Peruvian to me nor reminded me of Peruvian flavors. Where is the plethora of varieties of potatoes? Even Waffles Incaffeinated has mult-colored breakfast potatoes. A couple dishes seem like they could be inspired from some Latin American influences, but again, nothing like what I was expecting from my experience. With all that said we tried all 5 flavors of the empanadas they offered. They were OK at best and that was about as far as the line got pushed when it came to the main dishes. I tried the Tortilla de Papa, which was ok, but a little bland. The rice it came with was plain and the salad's dressing did not pack enough punch for me.

I see some other comments say that this is a hidden gem, but it is on the second floor above a deservedly better restaurant .

9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA,1UFPsc7Tc830N8NP1wAsWw,"I came here with a friend last Feb., and chose to visit it based on the positive reviews and the uniqueness of Peruvian food (I don't know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh that serves it).  Unfortunately, what I experienced was mediocre food and some of the worst service I've ever experienced.

My dining companion and I were seated promptly.  After 10 min., the waitress came over and asked about drinks.  After another 10 min., she brought our drinks and asked what we wanted to order.  I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.

Fifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.

It took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.

Unsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.  Also, none of the people working there seemed to be Peruvian, which is never a good sign in an ethnic eatery.  Based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon.",0,Z-BI5HJmC2HcpiVuXwVM3A,1,2,6/13/2014,review,3,,"I came here with a friend last Feb., and chose to visit it based on the positive reviews and the uniqueness of Peruvian food (I don't know of anywhere else in Pittsburgh that serves it).

I ordered the special, which was listed on the chalkboard (don't recall what it was exactly).  The waitress took our orders and went back to put them in.

Fifteen minutes later, the waitress returned, but not with our food.  Instead, she apologetically informed me that the special was not available because they were out of one of the necessary ingredients.  Um, why didn't she mention this immediately after she'd put the order in?  I chose a different entree (this time one of the regular ones), and the waitress went back to put that order in.

It took at least another 15 min. for the food to come out (we'd been there for 50 min., for those of you keeping track), and when it finally did, I was quite underwhelmed.  I don't recall what I ordered, but I know it had chicken and I recall the chicken being dry and bland--clearly, not what I was hoping for in a Peruvian restaurant!  This shouldn't have surprised me, since I noticed the waitress preparing it in the microwave.  Pro tip to restaurateurs: If you need to use a microwave in your food prep, it's best to hide it in the back.  Having been to Ecuador, where the food is similar to Peruvian fare, the food here certainly didn't seem very genuine.

Unsurprisingly, the check took at least 10 min. to show up once we'd finished.  By this time, I was through with this place.  Yeah, it has interesting decor, but that didn't make up for the abysmal service I received here.  Also, none of the people working there seemed to be Peruvian, which is never a good sign in an ethnic eatery.  Based on my experience, I won't be returning anytime soon., nan",2010-10,307,442,"['rpOyqD_893cqmDAtJLbdog', 'Zm9BUEVAA5Cxxrp0Kyq1xg', 'pz97SxRe1Vk-5_K6EB9OSA', 'zTWH9b_ItSdLOK9ypeFOIw',

UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA,QLj4cQ6cyL12Lzhx8GZsBA,"Something told me to be adventuresome when my first choice for lunch was closed for the day.  I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon here.  I saw Pamela's and thought oh well, if I can have breakfast for dinner, why not try breakfast for lunch.  When I walked in I saw the sign for the upstairs eatery and it piqued my interest.  

I can honestly say I have no clue as to what Peruvian food is and even though I partook in this delicious place I still have no concept into the food except that it tastes amazing.  We were seated almost immediately with menus in hand.  For lunch this place was not busy in the least.  Too bad for everyone else, because this is a great place to have lunch.  I skimmed the menu but the specials board is what really caught my attention.  I cannot remember the name of what I ate, but who cares, because it tasted so good that almost right after I finished my plate, short of licking it clean, I wanted more of the special!  The special was chicken atop cheese curd and then topped itself with pesto.  What an ideal combination of flavors.  The special also came with rice I believe and the house salad.  The salad was mixed greens with a combination of olives, walnuts and carrots.  The dressing was the house dressing and not too heavy or tangy.

Our server seemed a little inexperienced, but I won't hold that against her.  I am going to assume that she didn't know much about Peruvian food either.  Even though she really couldn't answer a lot of our questions about the food, she was swift and made sure we were taken care of.  

They also have shelves of Peruvian items that you can purchase if you are so inclined to do so.  I did not while I was here, but it does give you something interesting to look at and start a conversation about during your meal.",0,Z-BI5HJmC2HcpiVuXwVM3A,0,4,7/15/2013,review,0,,"Something told me to be adventuresome when my first choice for lunch was closed for the day.

yfRrC6MhxpIJ4-xMcrmk5Q,9-QmZmfMnD213tdURD8_wQ,"I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents, who were staying at a nearby B and B.  We wanted to go somewhere both casual and inexpensive, and La Feria definitely is both of those things.  We almost didn't find it - it's upstairs above Pamela's.  Pamela's was closed of course, but all the lights were on, and we eventually figured out to ascend the staircase and seek out La Feria. 

There was only one other table of diners, so it was very quiet in the eating area.  There are about 15 tables, and there are boldly colored Peruvian crafts everywhere you look!  We all decided to order lemonade and limeade, which was a great choice.  The drinks were refreshing and fresh, not too sour or too sweet.

I ordered one of the daily specials, which was chicken in a spicy peanut sauce.  It came with white rice, a green salad (with two kinds of cheese, two tomatoes slices, an olive, red onion, walnuts, and light dressing), and two slices of French bread.  The chicken itself was great - the sauce had a delicious peanut flavor and it went wonderfully with the rice.  I really liked the salad as well because the dressing was flavorful and I looooove cheese.  The bread was pretty standard, so I used it for dipping in leftover peanut sauce.  Nom!  My boyfriend got the ropa vieja sandwich, which I tasted.  Not as much meat as I'd like, but it was very juicy and flavorful.  Also the sweet potato chips that came on the side were totally addicting!

For dessert, we had a few shortbread cookies with what seemed like dulce de leche on them.  Everyone really enjoyed their meal.  It just feels like a good place to spend your money.  It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.  I think we'd be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood.

It's small, it's cheap, it's interesting food, and all their crafts are lovely and very affordable.  I think we'd be happy to go back if we were ever in the neighborhood.

d7W8pfj3LCy7mf9C23kITw,lx7zKzzu8vPqVwmljWaLiw,"I liked La Feria slightly more as a store than as a place to eat.  Even though I didn't buy anything, Bob was interested in a toucan ocarina, and I fantasized about affording a bright orange wooden lobster for my wall.  I also loved the tapestries, the retablos, and the Dia de los Muertos statues.

As for the food, it was pretty good, but I am on the picky side.  In fact, the whole meal was good, with one or two things keeping it shy of great.  We split two specials, one beef and one chicken, and both meats were a bit dry.   We had two empanadas, one spinach/feta and one ground beef.  The fillings were excellent, though they were (sadly!) understuffed.  

For dessert we tried the Alfajores, and this was the weakest part of the experience.  The pasty flavor of the thick shortbread cookies completely overwhelmed the mild sweetness of the dulce de leche.  I spent every bite trying to find it, to no avail.

It was a decent amount of food, though not as much as you'd expect for 10 dollars a person (we split the 20 dollar plate).

As for the atmosphere, it's cute, but cramped.  There's tons to look at while you're waiting a short time for your food.  The service wasn't too great: the waitress forgot our limeade.  But they were friendly enough, so I can't complain.

Here's the thing: in Pittsburgh, your pickings in South American food are very slim.  While this might sound like a negative review, it's not intended to be.  Until this area diversifies a bit more (currently at 2% Hispanic), or somehow finds more demand for good, authentic South American cuisine, I highly recommend checking La Feria out.

I went to La Feria for lunch today, my companion and I did not utter one word while there was food on the table.

We both started with ""Inca Cola"", a Peruvian ""Cream Soda"".  I'm not usually a soda drinker, but I felt like I should try something new.  It was unique, but a bit too sweet for my palate which isn't accustomed to drinking soda anymore.

We also split a sampler of their empanadas, which were amazing.  Perfect ratio of pastry to filling.  Perfectly seasoned fillings, perfectly cooked exterior that undercooked nor burnt.

For entrees, we both decided to get the ""pollo borracho"", BREAST OF CHICKEN BAKED WITH FRESH TOMATOES, OLIVES, CAPERS, AND WHITE WINE (from their website).  It came with a side of salad, rice, and french bread.  My companion paused after his first mouthful to say ""oh my god.  this chicken is amazing.""  We didn't speak again until both our plates were completely empty.  The salad, rice, and french bread were what were expected, but the chicken.  Wow.  I don't know how exactly they bake it, but the chicken breast was even more tender and moist than most of the chicken thighs i've eaten.  Not dry, not stringy by any means.  Completely exceeded my expectations.

Prices were definitely reasonable, w/ the daily entrees topping out the menu at $10.50.

I also like the homey feeling I get while in there.  There were around five other parties, which I think is pretty good since it was before noon on a Saturday and Pamela's is right next door.

Highly highly recommended, I'll most definitely be back.  For sure.",0,Z-BI5HJmC2HcpiVuXwVM3A,0,4,1/31/2009,review,1,,"I really don't know where to start.

It's a great environment: La Feria, in addition to a restaurant, also acts as a Peruvian shop. They sell clothes, toys, and even amazing chess sets. The seating is cozy, the people are friendly, and the food comes out pretty quickly.

Speaking of food: It's fantastic. You'll pretty much always want to get one of the specials; each day they have a meat special and a vegetable special, but both are always great.

I ordered the grilled chicken with a side of pasta with vodka sauce. The entrees also came with a salad or soup. I chose the salad with cheesy garlic dressing. Yes, the dressing is called cheesy garlic. It was a creamy, cheesy italian dressing. Delicious. I can definitely see using this dressing as a sauce for subs and chicken. The salads were also served with italian bread with a oil, balsamic and spices dip. Perfect compliment to my meal. Our entrees arrived quickly. I was very pleased with my choice.

At $17 per entree (with only one side, and a soup or salad) a patron should reasonably expect better quality., nan",2011-04,,96,[],,1,0,,user,,,,3.55,,[],Greg,5,,6,,,68,FALSE,,,11:00,,,,,11:00,FALSE,TRUE,full_bar,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,11:00,FALSE,"['American (Traditional)', 'Restaurants', 'Italian']",TRUE,11:00,Calabria's,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,2,FALSE,FALSE,,,20,,PA,TRUE,23:00,TRUE,TRUE,TRUE,"3107 Library Rd

tAKjY3bQXH51msJbOHYPmQ,9SA1wkmCMUmw1vZWlMQo-g,"For years...and I mean YEARS, I've heard of it, avoided it, and never had the least curiosity about it. It seemed like a waste of a ginormous building, and hype, hype, hype.  Plus, not being a beer drinker at ALL, the 'Brew' part certainly wasn't going to draw me in. But this past week, someone that I've been playing dueling restaurants with took me to Church Brew Works to see what it was all about.

Well, I guess it's pretty cool, if you're a tourist, a beer drinker, or don't mind busting a bank account on one meal.

The atmosphere is kind of cool in a kitschy way. Take a building once used to drain the soul, and turn it over to something that FEEDS the soul (or at least the liver). Not only is the enormous brew machinery on the altar a very cool replacement for bleeding martyrs, but it finally gives da burgh the centerpiece of worship that is befitting them. In addition to the apse-de-brew, all of the seating has been created from the old pews. Even the menus reflect old church programs.

Speaking of atmosphere and menus...I don't eat atmosphere, as I've pointed out in many other reviews. I ultimately go to an eatery to EAT. So after five minutes of taking in the 'atmosphere', I delved into the menu to make a selection.

I wasn't terribly impressed with the offerings, and I definitely was not impressed with the prices. If I end up planning my meal according to the menu prices, I've gone to the wrong place. And that is pretty much exactly what happened. We both chose a steak with cheesy potatoes and a corn salad, that was in the $15 range. My friend chose the 'beer sampler', which was like ten small glasses of beer that were supposed to be drunk in a specific order.  So our order was placed, and now on to sucking in more 'atmosphere'.

And I DO have to say that whoever places the orders for the wait studs in this place has impeccable taste in dark featured hunky real looking men. I was ready to take communion at any moment, or study up on what it means to be an altar boy.

Ok, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes. 

On the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good. 

Then came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.

But once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.

I can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.

Ok, atmosphere over, on to the food. The steak was cooked the way I liked it, and was very tender and flavorful. The cheesy potatoes, which I firmly believe are the leftovers from stuffing home made pierogis, was very pleasant and tasty as well. The corn salad, I could have used a few more words on the menu, or a heads up as to what all was in it, as onions are not my friend. I also think they could use a little better aim when putting it on the plate, or not use it as a sauce to top everything else on the plate, which seems to be what the aim was. I really didn't need the corn salad on the steak, or even dribbling over the potatoes. 

On the whole, except for the potential acid reflux from the surprise onions, the meal was satisfying and pretty good. 

Then came the dessert menu, and my friend opted for coconut cheesecake, and I had the tiramisu.  The tiramisu itself was great. My suggestion would be to drop the kind of fakey tasting chocolate poo blobs decorating the plate. They did nothing to enhance the flavor of the tiramisu, which would have been absolutely perfect by itself.

Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, the meal was good, and my friend liked most of his beer (with ten of them, it's naturally going to be hit or miss). The atmosphere was pleasant and not TOO over the top 'sports bar' video screenage, and the eye candy just kept walking back and forth.

But once again, I am drawn back to the high pricing, which is what will prevent me from becoming a regular. I'm not even a fan of being treated when the prices are that high. And as I said...if I'm choosing my meal by price more than by desire...I'm in a FTLT situation.

I can see how the place would appeal to a tourist, or to a black and gold anniversary dinner.  But as a regular haunt...not so much., nan",2011-08,10,118,"['UFr-WCtnNbX8O3sI7h4qeQ', 'B5WkNWDxZ-baWoQc6DBNHA', 'u1KESST6ATusVrn7F6HUvw', '9El5_hpRNiKV05SgXDvy3A', 'WMTm9HHRA3EewoxTX1Gleg', 'zYdFH6R1fKGJWgqcYEg5bw', 'Dsh4UCo9ny0XCrEJaF4aKg', 'aRCyarU83I2NkFSYql5CvA', 'bvu13GyOUwhEjPum2xjiqQ', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'TMXBVzWosPq2530CmXxFfA', 'RgxKeBvtDIFozPFmdIaGuA', '6dht9FiSN-wqKj4QFeqjew', 'op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g', 'So32N7bSbUd1RwhFtI6jTQ', 'UnGPr6ZnGe9YOSZRopnS5g', '8fApIAMHn2MZJFUiCQto5Q', 'jyU4yKXe63kk-si0OC62JQ', 'lvXyx043PaY6_JBQVZj-Zg', '2ft-ORIri49bRpfwFEr5QQ', 'H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg', 'ckLyJAIbb4Do-ymu8fwMQQ', 'WNTRbCbWxGMo6yfw7vzQ-Q', '4DrkZqFqLcyRcLWuQUXFeQ', 'UxfFAw2-cTpeWvRROF1HEw', 'SIxiPFipsTCh06R-RzY4Og', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'WQ6TB41vhe4WTyc7AqqYSA']",,22,8,12,user,14,22,1,3.52,,"[2012, 2013, 2014, 2015]",William,162,,195,,3,457,FALSE,,TRUE,16:00,TRUE,,,FALSE,16:00,FALSE,TRUE,full_bar,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,16:00,FALSE,"['Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,16:00,Church Brew Works,FALSE,FALSE,no,,FALSE,,TRUE,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,656,,PA,TRUE,0:00,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"3525 Liberty Ave

JbWnXwjLaO1kncUkQOMajg,xW9kal9eExx-KE8vOVL_kg,"My favorite restaurant in the Burgh, this place has yet to let me down.

I love that they have a specials page in the menu, so I make it a point to order something from it every time I visit. From chanterelle soup (with a nice story about the owner picking the mushrooms himself), to the Octoberfest pizza, to the bolognese lasagna, to the special pierogis - nothing on this menu has disappointed me in the least. I like that this part of the menu goes along with the seasons as well, it keeps the food fresh and keeps me on my toes when searching for dinner.

On a special note, the pizza here is definitely underrated. The crust is fantastic and you can actually see the pizza station tucked away in a corner of the church, so you know exactly what work goes into making such a delectable dough delight.

Along with the food, the beer is good as well. One of my pet peeves is a brewery that makes a watery stout (see: rock bottom), and thankfully the beer at the Church meets my expectations. Their seasonal/rotating beers are a great way to switch things up as well, and I have found myself contemplating the finer points in life while enjoying many of their brews.

If you hate good food and good beer, the setting itself is worth a visit. On my first visit, I couldn't believe that this place is actually just a church that was renovated to a brewpub. Stained glass windows - check, pipe organ - check, pews for seating - check. This place has it all.

So go for the food, beer, and atmosphere, get one of the specials and a new beer, and leave happy.",0,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,0,5,11/6/2010,review,0,,"My favorite restaurant in the Burgh, this place has yet to let me down.

I literally can't go there anymore because of the smell. I know it's because of the brewery and the yeast they use for the beer. But ugh....I can't shake it. I smell it when I come in, I smell it when I eat and I smell it on me after I leave. 

It's such a shame too because the place is just gorgeous! Obviously, it used to be a church and they've kept a lot of the original stain glass windows. Even the pews and tables you sit at are originally from the church. 

I.just.can't.take.the.smell. 

Also, I'm not really a fan of the beer they brew. I've tried it a bunch of times and it just never seems to stand out for me. The food is not bad either. I've had the pizza's, which are offered in a variety of different types. I seriously just can't take the smell. 

I'm sure I'll get talked into going again sometime, but hopefully it's in the summer when I can sit outside. The outside does have a great set up. Plus, you don't have the smell. 

I'm sure the point has come across the smell wasn't there I'd probably not mind the place.

This old Roman Catholic church turned brewery/restaurant had great ales and specialty brews, an extensive wine list, a huge vodka selection and the best menu in western Pennsylvania. The brick oven pizzas are incredible with imaginative toppings.  Try a sampling of all the beers including the bottled fresh Thundergod IPA, and the Pius monk dunkle. All of the stained glass windows are intact and all of the tables and bar stools were fabricated from the church pews. The outdoor patio area reminds me of eating outdoors in Germany. One is completely surrounded by red brick ivy covered walls. I've had friends from New York, Vancouver, and Toronto visit Pittsburgh and I've taken them here for dinner and they all had a great time.

The Coconut Stout beer was scrumptious. 

Our server Megan was all-around awesome. 

I loved the Wild Boar Quesadillas and the Belgian Fries with that superyummy lemon-caper aioli.

My Chicken Madrid was excellent. The braised chicken came with sofrito, smoked pineapple, crispy polenta, and a salad of fennel, radish and celery. So good!!! 

Darren and I both shared the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the Malted Bread Pudding with malted chocolate ice cream, and they were each amazing. 

We never smelled anything funny. The interiors are huge and gorgeous and resemble a chatty dining hall.

The pizza is out of this world and the appetizers and daily specials always have something interesting that catches my eye.  

While the food is good, the beer is better.  I find myself a fan of their seasonal offerings more than the signature brews which makes me sad because I keep having to find a new favorite.  Ask for samples if you're not sure.  But if you find something you really like that's a seasonal, get a growler before you leave.

We ordered the homemade chips, which were delightful, before setting off to the next destination., nan",2013-03,18,168,"['AMuyuG7KFWJ7RcbT-eLWrQ', 'FP79xn8H2XXnMksRuP5l6A', 'fwsJGulnozT2U6FefsLiFw', '-7lO3DFiZeJCo_XPFaEr3Q', 'u2F_wCshIRLCKO0Un2R3ow', '0mFcyRrJQhAPN0ey1FcMcA', '8Owqa92fyZpNGVFAMlZ_9g', '9OZH1Ecw-qUkCW5MS0NefA', '4BWGVJEqqOnihPxnZbuEzQ', '9cCTmiJ7hz35rHIdr8n9kA', '-0itF0VWVBe3k2AdfUReGA', 'UD7Y1CqfY6mDmRwIuCf6nA', 'GMtILOfAHXUMrfMgLPG0gg', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'MA713-m2wv51bww8LN2fSA', 'dEfFa1y8HOvwjd3Tztzs0g', 'Nhvkukz5MECqEUQVfh6A6w', 'ZDsneygztCiyFpkwSV0oTQ', 'Ynt9QATr3tur66_OVQNCng', '6Mflt7fworNLu031TDrDSA', 'IAvhZoADlrmQaGd3cCSOSA', 'suRGJir2NmSZVnixdIN22Q', 'pKh4Pc96YbOg-6hBOOajAA', 'op2Gve4sAMQ4qEzq2Tad0g', 'V9stMNThQQGLY1Ba7kfqQw', 'FKosz9ExVLhsrITQk5xl4g', '11Ydte1VfE85UHK24d4QRQ', 'PazhV6VV8mzVwuo5N6yT8g', 'PEKTzYqZw0ztaBj1ZfoRaA', 'DXnFLwB3wetH3uAV1zaDrg', 'IB4Oxk8IlNG2K0oH0I9Dkg', 'H4NhdCLWClmdNFe7ej7Njg', '9vzYSXp42wHvoVDFMROCBQ', 's_sAdwMW2aimtkrJyi0UCw', 'hlpHSNcosmjXQ-gfGXFGRw', 'UgPa7ByY6r7R9nQPC6HAyA', 'Hys6HzKi24j2809kI_7dKA', 'Xk8ZXjwQf52U_P8RX5o9lQ', 'lRpH7dk3oT0tQP8_dM4guw', '2BYGvFAgV87LgIk4EqLtwg', 'WGXfllGHz1rnXbVLB8pTkg', 'vxnURgPJYWP9Ub2Wav8woA', 'OltbotTvVqaVHooXphbOrA', 'OXF2mmi2UNvYBnHe7NnvOg', 'HF0FNcAoGgU7nC9S6HgZng']",,16,4,6,user,10,23,1,3.83,2,"[2014, 2015]",Maura,256,,96,3,,313,FALSE,,TRUE,16:00,TRUE,,,FALSE,16:00,FALSE,TRUE,full_bar,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,16:00,FALSE,"['Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,16:00,Church Brew Works,FALSE,FALSE,no,,FALSE,,TRUE,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,656,,PA,TRUE,0:00,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"3525 Liberty Ave

The beer here was very nice. I ordered the Celestial Gold. I'm not a huge fan of dark beer so I thought this would be a great option and i really enjoyed it! Bobby ordered the Polaris Patersbier which is explained in their menu blonde belgian beer with minty/hop aromas and a herbal/pine finish with a little bitterness.. woah that explained it perfectly. How do they do that? I stuck with the same beer and next he tried Pious Monk Dunkel . It wasn't his favorite so he ended with the patersbier :) i noticed a few people ordering the beer sampler (as well as pictures of it on yelp) I did not see this advertised in the menu and totally forgot about it. Maybe next time :( (Where was this located in their beer menu?!)

For appetizer, we ordered the traditional perogies. The onions were perfect! I could have had them as a side dish. 

For dinner, I ordered the southwest chicken wrap and upgraded to sweet potato fries.  To be honest, the fries were not hot at all which was a real bummer because i LOVE sweet potato fries. Everywhere i've went, the restaurant served the fries with a honey cinnamon dip. CBW served with a chipotle ketchup. Dont get me wrong, it was a nice twist on ketchup, but it did not go with sweet potato fries at all. Seriously. Who thought sweet potato fries and spicy ketchup went together? 

Bobby ordered the shrimp & grits.... DELICIOUS. I was skeptic because It seems like a light brunch affair, not dinner but it was very filling and was made perfectly. 

For dessert, we ordered the frozen peanut butter mouse cake. It was okay.. nothing too special.

I found service to be average. The GM was walking around so happy and peppy asking tables about their meal. Also, when walking to the restroom all of the other servers seemed happy and great with their tables. Our server Ashley put no enthusiasm into the night and kind of seemed annoyed when we asked about the different beers. Also, our dirty appetizer plate sat on our table the entire meal even though i put it right on the end and Ashley stopped at our table a few times. It was a little awkward especially because i used to serve and a big tip is to clear the table when you see dirty plates. Whatever.. 

Service, my crappy sweet potato fries & the mediocre dessert are stopping me from the 4 star review.

So why three stars?  Over priced for what you get - luckily we were not too hungry our we would have left craving more.  Also, the service was so so at best and the food took more time than usual.   I didn't really like the environment of the outdoor seating either.

This place is real cool on the inside.  They didn't even strip out the pews; they turned them into booths.  It was real cool.

Q3fFv_ft17OyV-NRF1iQxw,3_dkp4sy55f76ly4oTCLkA,"Every Pittsburgh resident must go to Church Brew Works at least once. My husband and I have also enjoyed taking friends and family members to this unique establishment. At first, I wasn't sure what to think of a pub located within an old church. As a church-goer myself, I felt that I may be breaking some sort of 11th commandment by drinking there. However, I felt much better when I arrived. The restaurant has done an amazing job of maintaining the beauty of the church while creating an all new environment.

I've enjoyed all of the drinks that I've ordered here but particularly like the Cherry Quadzilla. One complaint would be that they always seem to be out of a beer listed on their permanent menu, which is very annoying. Someone in our group always seems to order an elusive beer which leads to frustration when it's unavailable.

Though a little overpriced, I've enjoyed the traditional pierogies ($6.50) and pizzas ($13-15.50). They are descent, but by no means items that I couldn't find somewhere else for less. I have never tried any of the entrees. Entrees range from $15-34, which all seem overpriced. Though the restaurant is cool, I don't think it's fine dining enough to charge more than $15-20 for entrees.

During my last visit in September, our food took nearly an hour to come out. Every second that we waited felt like a minute due to an unhappy baby being with us, but I did think the wait was a bit long for having just ordered appetizers and pizzas. Note to self -- don't dine there on the weekends if you want to be in and out within an hour.

Though I recommend visiting this restaurant at least once, it's excitement and novelty really lies purely within the location.

The deal was sealed when my mom had told me she saw on national TV that it's one of the best places to eat in the Burgh.  She was salivating at the thought of a pirogi pizza.  So when my mom came down to cash in on her Mother's Day gift, my sister and I decided to bring her here to eat first.

There was ample parking behind the building so no need to worry about finding a spot on the street.  Walking in, being that this restaurant is located in a old church, you feel as if there is a spiritual awakening about to happen.  And there is one about to happen.

When you enter, make your seating selection wisely.  You can either sit by the bar, or in their 'dining area.'  Depending on what side you sit is the type of menu you are handed.  We chose the dining are and because we were thinking about the pizzas, we had to ask for the bar menu, even if it was just to look.  Also, don't forget to check out the board on your way in to check out the specials and what the untraditional pirogi are for the day.

After looking over the menu, we opted not to have a pizza because we were afraid it wouldn't hold up in the car after we left here.  My mom chose the traditional pirogi with the homemade chips.  Sister decided on Yinzer Cheesesteak with fresh cut fries.  And I couldn't pass up the untraditional pirogi for the day: asparagus and cream cheese.  I also got a side of Belgian fries with lemon caper aioli.  These pirogi were amazing.  I was a bit worried at first when I saw the mixture, but totally surprise by how good the combo worked.  The Belgian fries hit the spot as well, the dip was a nice sweet combo.  My mom loved her traditional perigees and had so much of the chips left over they went home with her.  My sister's Yinzer cheesesteak looked good.  It's just a cheesesteak...Pittsburgh style, i.e. read that as a cheesesteak with fries and cole slaw on it.

The service was top notch here too.  The server knew every answer and was knowledgeable about all the items on the menu.  The hostess when we walked in and I asked a question about the untraditional pirogi did not know the answer but told me if I did get them, let her know how they tasted so she could pass it on to other customers.

Everything in here is interesting to look at.  While we waited for our food, we just looked around a lot.  Each of us pointing at various items throughout the building.  Even the bathrooms were nifty.

6QhWTugzBJ3cdv2N4WZcSA,uloypVTkngzJNhftFEC0qQ,"Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience. There were probably 40 people in the restaurant, but the sprawling size of the place makes it seem empty with that size crowd. It's a really cool space, between the brewing equipment and church relics, so there's a lot to look at and discuss. There's even lots of helpful info about the history of the place and beer brewing in the menu.

We started with the ""Nontraditional Pierogies"" (as opposed to the Traditional Pierogies) which change periodically; today they were stuffed with potato, chicken, andouille sausage, peppers, and pepper jack cheese (that I can remember) and DARN they were tasty, just needed a bit of salt though.

We also had fries with beer cheese. The fries themselves were okay, Potato Patch style but a little overdone. The beer cheese was pretty tasty as well.

For an entree we had the ""Cinco Formaggio"" (a name I find quite odd, since cinco is Spanish and formaggio is Italian...but I digress). The combination of cheeses plus pine nuts is mild and yet very yummy, the pine nuts add a nice crunch. The crust is heavenly, though I wish it had a teensy bit more salt and perhaps some butter or olive oil to moisten it a bit.

We also, of course, tried a couple beers, which were good in my book but I'm not by any means a beer connoisseur, so I can't do much describing other than to say I liked it.

Our server was very friendly and helpful -- checked on us enough times, refilled my water, all that good stuff. All in all we definitely enjoyed the meal and hope to come back for more soon!",1,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,0,4,7/10/2010,review,2,,"Just got back from Church Brew Works, as we had a pretty good experience.

I think that the ups and downs noted are just a matter of individual taste . . . or perhaps, lack of.

I say . . .go try it for yourself.

The fact that it is a restaurant and brew works that has been put in an old church is worth the trip alone. Worth it just to see what can be done with a great old building and a little imagination.

Try the beer. Have lunch or dinner. See what you think. Don't let a few misguided souls scare you off. 

I've usually found that when a place has so many reviews that are so across the board it is because some folks get out of their comfort zone . . . they begin to get uncomfortable when things deviate. Or when you put them in a church.

Well, I'm here to tell you that good food comes in all sorts of shapes & colors & flavors. Of course, so does bad,  But the one thing I know is that . . .  it can't be both.

L2ne7hSJDy0U6sBD8wVaQA,gD_4xA4FbHU9kO2l3NjP1w,"I have always been a fan of the Church Brew Works and have been visiting the establishment for most of my adult life.  As a person who grew up in a Catholic church what's not to love?  I practically worship beer, so beer being on center stage on the altar conjures up something special when I walk through those heavy wooden doors.  I almost wish they put beer in the white marble holy water fonts to make the sign of the cross as you enter.
Now for my latest experience as it's been probably three years since I have attended church due to travels and living abroad.  
My parents were in town and my dad loves everything about the beer making process, especially the consumption part.  It was also my wife's birthday and she too loves good beer, so to the Church we went.
Everyone minus me hadn't been there before, so there was a bit of awe factor for the noobs.  Though we were all a bit disappointed with generic wreath hanging on the plexi-glass barrier guarding the altar.  I don't remember this barrier in my prior visits, a small negative, but a negative none-the-less.  
We were seated in a heavy traffic area at a small table, which we requested later to be moved to more cozy location.  This request was met graciously and as a former server I understand you have to try to seat someone in those places....
We all ordered our beers and my father requested the Sour Piet.  Much to his dismay they returned with our beers and three samples glass of beers that were not Sour Piet.  He was informed that had kicked the keg earlier, but hadn't known.  He tasted the other beers and decided to get the Thunderhop (my favorite).  We only had Thunderhops and Cherry Saisons.  Both were very good, as per usual.  Disappointing that they had run out of the Sour, and a little miffed that our server was not privy to it being gone, but again just a little negative.
We ordered two large pizzas -- The Cinco Formaggio and the Wild Boar BBQ.  Both were cooked perfectly in their amazing brick oven.  The pizzas were a bit too salty for our standards and they seemed to skimp on some of the ingredients so the balance was lost a little.  The Wild Boar was very good, but it lacked something, maybe spice or tang.  I think there was only a few slivers of the red onions on it....Again a small disappointment. 
After polishing off the majority of our pizzas my dad asked our server to fill up a 64oz growler with the Cherry Saison.  The server acted like this would be near impossible since it was a seasonal and limited brew, but said he'd try.  He returned triumphantly and bragged about how he'd done us a favor since they were out of Sour Piet.  An obvious ploy to get a little added to his tip, but again a small disappointment.
I hope you caught on to the trend of a lot of little disappointments added up to make it a good experience, but not great.  I usually go after work for beers and pizzas with friends, for this it never disappoints.  But for a special occasion with family that has higher standard it left a little to be desired. 
 Our experience was 3 stars, but because of all my fond memories I gave it 4.

The food and beer was always phenomenal every other time we visited. This time we went at about 4:00 PM on a Saturday. The restaurant was only about 2/3's full. The first thing we noticed was everything from the front doors, to the chandeliers, to the bathrooms, were very dusty, dirty and dingy. There were spider webs hanging from the ceiling in the dining room. We were almost afraid to eat there.  
    My wife's appetizer came out 10 minutes after mine and was over cooked. Our dinners were overall well below average for the price. Our favorite entrees were definitely not the same. The flavors were not what they were before and the portion size was too small.
    The bar tender was drinking beer behind the bar which seemed very unprofessional. It seems like this restaurant is under new management and they have lost their good chefs.

R4crU2OjJ7-qAymiHO2Ucw,J7NCFwoWF59mlOOWuxDQGg,"Church Brew Works is really frustrating. I'll be using that word a lot in this review. If they would just pick a direction when it comes to the food, it would be so much more enjoyable to come here. As they are now, I was very unimpressed. 

I would come here just to drink however, because their beer was actually pretty great. I tried a pale ale that I can't for the life of me remember what it was called, and the Pious Monk Dunkel, which was my favorite of the 2. It's a darker beer, but not too bitter and doesn't have a strong hoppy taste. It was like, my perfect beer. I also had a glass of Sauvignon Blanc, and it was very nice. They also make a mean dessert martini. Don't worry, I didn't order all of this stuff for myself. I just surround myself with lightweights and then finish their drinks. ;) 

The food however, was so uninspiring to me. They had multiple menus: a winter menu, a dinner menu, and a pub menu that has a lot of the same things the dinner menu does, plus sandwiches and pizza. I had a Kobe beef cheese steak off the pub menu, and it was good, but it tasted just like any other cheese steak I've ever had. My mom got soup and salad that she wasn't super impressed with, and my dad got a shrimp etouffee that was shockingly out of this world. I had one bite, and it was 2009 and I was on a balcony in New Orleans again. It certainly packed a punch.

Nothing I had was bad, but I literally needed half an hour with the menus just to find something that sounded somewhat appealing. If you're a brewery restaurant, why don't you just have ONE menu full of food that would taste good with a beer? Instead, everything seemed overly complex, disjointed, and just plain unappetizing. Nothing I saw sounded good. I can't even remember the last time that's happened to me at a restaurant. I hope I'm not out of line in saying any of this, I may have just been having a bad night and I have been watching a lot of Kitchen Nightmares episodes lately so maybe I'm being a snob. I was just so completely disappointed with the food choices given to me, and if I were asked to describe the type of cuisine served here, I would have no idea what to tell you. They've got pierogies, but nothing else Polish, they've got Etouffee, but nothing else Creole, they've got mussels and a salmon dish, but it's not a seafood restaurant. They've got a pub menu, but not pub food. It was just frustrating. I don't think I'll go back here to eat unless they rework their menu. I would come back for the beer however.

I forgot to mention service though, and it was fantastic. John was friendly, funny, enthusiastic, prompt, and knowledgeable about the beer. He was able to recommend based on our tastes, and his choices were spot on. Great server. 

The building itself is really cool, the beer was great, but the menu was just a hot mess, in my humble opinion.

And Catholic guilt is appropriate for this venue as, obviously, ""Church"" Brew Works is located in a very old Catholic Church.  

When you walk in if you're Catholic, by habit, you'll want to dip your hands into the Holy Water holder that is sans Holy Water.  But your eyes will immediately go to the old altar that now holds large vessels that are brewing and fermenting some pretty great beer.  That being said, be aware that you're going to smell some pretty strong malty-sweet aromas from the brewing.  On my most recent visit it was stronger than I would have preferred.  But no fear, we were able to sit outside, which is like transforming yourself into a scene from Harvard in the late 1800's.  The little courtyard patio outside is two levels surrounded by brick walls covered in ivy.  You can sit with a small group or bring all your friends and grab the picnic table with the long bench.  Either scenario is going to be great.

Onto the food.  Oh how I love the menu here.  I always want to go for the wood fired pizzas because they rock - and there are so many culinary treats to choose from like pierogie pizza or chicken and pineapple or wild boar BBQ.  That's right, I said Wild Boar and I'm not lying.  Amazing thin crust wood fired to perfection.

scIDar9VGDMcTOHbem37pg,-58X851XktBXz7AqLXN19g,"First impression, quite an awesome building. 

I walked through the front doors of the church (flashbacks/guilt kicked in automatically) to a camera crew. Apparently the Food Network was filming some sort of show because of their pierogies (which is pretty cool).  It was a bit hectic inside so we decided to take advantage of the weather and sit in the courtyard. 

The outdoor courtyard was nice and cozy. I have been in better ones but I have definitely been in worse ones. 

Food: I got the a Mediterranean salad, although I was a bit hesitant because it was $16 with shrimp.  The old man was footing the bill so I went for it but was a bit underwhelmed when the salad came out.  For $16 I was excepting a Mediterranean island on my plate...but no. My sister got the pierogies which were decent.  They were a bit cold by the time I got to them which was my fault. My dad got a fish sandwich which was the best thing on the table. Crunchy, flakey, moist (eww) 

Drinks: Solid beer list but I opted for wine tonight. It was a chilly night so I went with red. One glass of Cab Sav and one glass of Zinfandel. Delish. 

Pros: Architecture, Great drink list, outdoor seating, nice but awkward waiter, changing specials

Cons: Strangely expensive for random items, cheesy plastic furniture on patio (really? you spend how much money on redoing the venue but you couldn't throw some wrought iron furniture into the mix), food took a bit but I think that was because of the Food Network event. 

Overall: Will go back. I think I will just get some apps and focus more on drinking my meal.",1,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,0,3,10/10/2010,review,3,,"First impression, quite an awesome building.

The food for the price is a little underwhelming other than their Pizza's. They are pretty delicious for the price so I would shoot for that when going here. The beer is pretty good I am a fan of the Pious Monk Dunkle and a few of their other beers. 

Last time I was here the order time on the Pizza's were about 45 min - 1 hour so it took a while but I think they were just overly busy that night, so I think I can forgive them for that. The waitress was apologetic and nice so it wasn't a big deal.

MSuyK2p8G9hEqyWf5IgnYQ,fhVpDtz9rWI_ZzapW1a58g,"Boyfriend's birthday- trying to think of some place that will make him and his mom (who can be pretty picky) happy. I mentioned CBW and since it's been about 3 years since we last visited, we decided to check it out. It's a great place to take family who have never been there- the fact that it is a brewery in a church makes it a unique experience before you even order a drink or food item. Do not fret because it is in Lawrenceville- it's not in the hustle and bustle of Butler Street and they have their own parking lot. There is also straight parking available if need be. 

The church itself is huge and it's beautiful. I LOVE that they were able to save this building and use it in such a creative way. Upon arriving, you have a choice between sitting in the bar area or dining area. We chose the dining area, but did ask our server for the bar menu as well (the pizzas and sandwiches were listed only on this menu). Since it has been a while for me, I decided to order the sampler- which allowed me to try 6 different beers. One complaint is that their beer menu is a little confusing to read and the paper they place the beers on do not state each beer they have. Our server named off the beers she gave me, but by the time I made it to the seasonals, I could not remember the names of the beers. Next time, I know to drink the seasonals first, when the names have not disappeared from my brain. Not to mention, their samplers are expensive- $9-$10 for 6 little beers. Although, I do have to say that their beer was pretty decent! None of their regular brews were strong and they all were easy to drink. Although I appreciated those qualities, I would have appreciated a little more complexity in their taste. One of the seasonals I tried was their thunderhop, which REALLY impressed me. Anything with fruity notes and hops, I usually love and this one was no different! The flavors were perfect.

My boyfriend wanted the corn dog appetizer to start. Three huge, fresh corn dogs were presented to us- with a spicy ketchup and a honey mustard on the side. We really enjoyed them and could tell they were homemade by their quality. For our meals, I ordered the pierogi saut?? (potato and cheese pierogis with garlic cream sauce, tomatoes, broccoli and fresh herbs), the boyf ordered a steak sandwich with fries and his mom ordered the traditional  appetizer size pierogi. My original choice was the Caribbean chicken wrap, so long as the chicken could be warm, instead of chilled. My server explained that could not be done- which led me to assume the wraps were premade, which turned me off. 

I was really impressed with my pierogis. The sauce was creamy and not overpowering with garlic, the pierogis were perfect and the broccoli and tomatoes were fresh and delicious. The fresh herbs brought all of the flavors together, making the entire dish absolutely delicious. The only odd thing was that the tomatoes were cold- which was a little offsetting. My boyf was not impressed with his steak sandwich and said it tasted like ""steak umms"". After looking at the steak, I would guess that he was right about that. He didn't hate it though and was able to eat it- but wouldn't order it again. His mom loved her traditional pierogis and raved about them the whole meal. 

Our waitress gave us two boxes for our meals and even wrote what our dishes were, CBW and the date on each box. I found that to be extremely awesome and helpful! 

Overall, I think this place is famous for their pierogis, pizzas and beer and I probably won't steer off of that path. Our service was great, the food was delicious and the beers were good- it was a very good experience.

wzewQMHDSnEeh0ZGC7DU0A,f2G6EypLG5foPgpUxXfr_A,"Probably better off skipping this place next time I visit but had to see the place bc a huge church turned brewery is a really cool concept.

A few of the beers here are ok.  The bartender initially was sort of a douche.  Either he confuses rudeness with having a personality or he was nearing the end of his shift and just DGF and it fails to reflect well on the establishment.  The girl that took over for him 20 minutes later was much more personable.

A couple of tasty beers here but fewer than other breweries in this town.  

What is really absurd is that the bar-keeps I talked to completely agree that the beers suck, but the place opts to serve the shit rather than dump it and just brew something better.  

Tried a beer sampler.  Four regular beers and four seasonals.  I liked the Celestial gold, and the Pipe Organ Pale Ale

The thunderstyle(i think that was the name?) IPA, some licorice mint concoction (sucked), the early summer brew ""confessional kolsch"" (again, i think that was the name) were not my cup of tea.  

Behind the bar was a mess.  Wet floors, a clusterfuck of tangled hoses, multiple Dish/glass racks stacks all over the place, wet floors, dusty display of glasses....just a general unsanitary/under-managed feel. That made me & my bro think things like the kitchen....which we cannot see....would only be worse off.  Eff-it, we wound up ordering a little food. Very little food.  Spinach-feta-gouda dip.

The space is gorgeous, high ceilings, organ, pipes, stained glass, etc.  This place has outdoor seating, however I always seem to forget.

6xQnzz_TS0skNM1GIK8j8w,2FjzrCDTjuCkIK63hepH0Q,"I was just reminded to rate Church Brew Works after reading another yelp review that mentioned the smell of the place. It is very obviously caused by the beer they brew there, but it reminds me of being in a barn. Not a barn with dirty animals, but an old barn with lots of old hay all over the ground. It's not CBW's fault that I can't handle that smell because that is a side effect of brewing beer within a restaurant, but I can't do it.  

The only other con for CBW is that I don't like some of their beer. Let me be clear, *some* of their beer is not for me, but I've had a few that I like, and if you're unsure you can always order samples. Every time I've been to CBW the staff has been great and they are more than willing to bring samples (and take pictures of you and your best friend who is visiting from out of town.)

All of the food I've eaten at CBW was good, but the desserts were really GREAT. The most memorable dessert experience involved splinting multiple desserts (something seasonal and another off the regular menu), and BEER ICE CREAM. Beer. Ice Cream. Do I need to say more? It was better than expected. 

One last note- I hate saying things that are even slightly negative if the restaurant has done nothing wrong, and Church Brew Works really has a lot of things going very well for them, but me being ""sensitive"" (or something) can't handle inhaling barn-like fumes while eating.

This is what I have found. Since I am in summer work out mode I tend to eat salads and protein a ton. What's better than a Buffalo Brgr! I get this as my lunch every so often. Juicy, lean, flavorful, bison, cooked medium well! No bun with a side of broccoli. It keeps me full, tastes wonderful and powers me up for a P90 workout! 

I also LOVE the Pulled pork sandwich and Cuban! I did like the pulled pork better when they served it on a pumpernickel raisin bun! 

So lets talk fire brick oven pizza! I like simplicity so the mozzarella, basil is my favorite! Pair that with the beer sampler and you have quite a nice Saturday afternoon couples outing! 

The last time I went to dine with my family we all ordered different items then shared everything! We had the shrimp carbonara, crispy vegetarian polenta, and the Buffalo and wild mushroom meatloaf. The carbonara was creamy and bacony, just as it should be. The meatloaf was super juicy and had a very good flavor, my dish the veggie polenta was tomato based and just ok, It is perfect option if you are vegan or watching calories! 

I just love bringing out of towners here, the majestic space and the ambiance, are unmatched. Be ready to become infused with a hoppy humidity! There is also a cute outdoor patio that is very inviting. Everyone in Pitt should frequent here! 

On a side note, I had ordered a pizza to go for my family the day we went since they had helped me move. It ended up being burned on the top so check your to go's! Management was extremely accommodating and hooked me up with a pie when I brought my friend for the sampler!

The environment is beautiful.  Much like in churches of the time, you aren't sure where to look because there are so many beautiful features.

The menu is extremely unique with everything from run of the mill pastas to pizzas to alligator pierogies.  And the food we tried was great.  But the prices are quite high for the food you get, especially considering they are double most other brew pub restaurants in the area.

I ordered the pierogi pizza at the recommendation of several Yelpers.  I can see why it was pricey - it was HUGE.  I wish they had size options for the pizzas as this pizza could have easily served three people.  It is a good thing I loved the pizza as I'll be eating it for the next three meals.  My husband had the pasta in peanut sauce and thought it was very tasty.  Again, the portion was HUGE.    We had both ordered appetizers and would not have if we had known the food portions were so large.  

The french onion soup was fantastic but the wings were nothing to write home about.  I ordered the peanut sauce version and expected them to be tossed in the sauce.  Instead, I had plain wings with a side of the sauce delivered.  I did dip them, but tossing the wings adds to the flavor because some of it soaks in.  I'm not sure if all of their wings are served this way or just the peanut sauce ones, but it seemed strange.

We were originally hoping to try some dessert, but with the giant portions, we had no room left.

In all, an enjoyable experience with good beer, food and service, but a little to pricey to be more highly recommended.",0,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,0,3,6/5/2013,review,0,,"If the prices weren't so high, I would have given this restaurant more stars.

If you have to dine here, do yourself a favor and only order a pizza--the pizzas are actually quite excellent.

Their beer is awful.  I know a thing or two about making beer and here it the thing:

You need to hire a brew master experienced enough to know WHEN beer is finished, and I can also tell that this beer is 'messed around with' too much during the brewing process.  get a better brew master, seriously.

NONE of these beers taste finished.  Not one.  At best, the IPA is kind of alright.  the rest of the beers just smell like urine, and they dont taste much better either.

oh--and the restaurant STINKS inside.  its the yeast they use for the beer, but it's off putting.

The last time I dined there, I ordered the meat loaf and it took forever to come to the table and when it did arrive, it was cold and it had sat so long in the kitchen that a skin had formed on the gravy.  Yuck.

our waiter was an asshole.  Very patronizing, to the point where I almost said something.

Oc3LydKbnaJjchuPZ6hQ1g,1mQAWU16zhFyy5L2jGEzWQ,"I had been wanting to visit the Church Brew Works ever since seeing it featured on the Food Network show Outrageous Food. In that episode, they featured the restaurant's ""rattlesnake pierogies"" I was disappointed to find this was not a regular menu item, instead they offer either ""traditional"" or ""untraditional"" pierogies- on the night of our visit the untraditional ones were Bufflale Chicken style, and boy were they good! I still want to try those rattlesnake ones though...

I also had the onion soup and the bison meatloaf which were both delicious, especially the meatloaf. My spouse enjoyed the jambalaya which was nice and spicy. As to the beers, there was a decent selection of styles from lager to dunkel to belgian to stout....and our server accomodated our request to sample some of the brews before deciding. Our favorite of the night was the Thunderhop which had a wonderful hoppy flavor. 

As to the ambiance- well I think it is well worth a trip if you are in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is a converted church complete with stained glass windows and wooden pews (ok they are not the most comfortable seats but it adds to the effect!) and where the alter would have been are the giant beer tanks.

We found the service to be very prompt and our server answered all our questions concerning beer and food.

I thought this restaurant was a good value for the money. Dinner for two was just under $70 before tip- and our meal included 4 pints of beer, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.

As to the beers, there was a decent selection of styles from lager to dunkel to belgian to stout....and our server accomodated our request to sample some of the brews before deciding. Our favorite of the night was the Thunderhop which had a wonderful hoppy flavor. 

As to the ambiance- well I think it is well worth a trip if you are in Pittsburgh. The restaurant is a converted church complete with stained glass windows and wooden pews (ok they are not the most comfortable seats but it adds to the effect!) and where the alter would have been are the giant beer tanks.

We found the service to be very prompt and our server answered all our questions concerning beer and food.

I thought this restaurant was a good value for the money. Dinner for two was just under $70 before tip- and our meal included 4 pints of beer, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.

L4FoQv59PsfhV1lIZGGT1g,rjqzIGCBMJiAyj1bkOHTcg,"Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.   

I absolutely agree with every other reviewer that the service is appalling.  We were told to sit anywhere, so we grabbed a high table near the bar. We were ignored and made to feel unwelcome by our indifferent, bored, rude server with questionable hygiene.  The server, Antonio, did not introduce himself when he initially came around to take our order, the point at which servers usually welcome you to the establishment.  (We only discovered his name from the check at the end)  He simply asked how many were in the party, presumably so he could gauge what his tip would be.  Since there were only two of us (again, intimate dinner with fiance), he decided we weren't worth much effort.

We waited a long time for him to come around to take our order, so we decided instead of ordering appetizers and really savoring our meal, we'd just get a quick pizza.   The server realized the tab wouldn't be high since I wasn't going to be drinking and we weren't ordering soups, salads, or any appetizers so he decided right then we weren't worth even the most basic level of service.  

When the pizza finally came out, it had a 3-inch long curly black hair on it.  Both my fiance and I are dirty blonds, and the hair uncannily matched our lackadaisical server's unkempt black hair and unruly beard.    (hey I got nothing against beards by the way, my honey's got one, but this guy could use some trimmers)
 
After the hirsute discovery, we waited another 20 minutes or so for him to come around and check to see how the meal was so that I could point out the hair.  He didn't seem bothered but offered to get a new pizza for us, which took another 30 minutes. 

The pizza was so-so, and we had to wonder the whole time if there was anything 'extra' deposited in there by the annoyed waiter.

No surprise we waited a VERY VERY long time for the check.  I was considering just walking out but finally my fiance flagged down a waitress, told her we hadn't seen our server in a long time.  She asked for his name, which we didn't know at that point, and then asked for a physical description.  Since this place has 30 high- school/college-aged kids working there, our description happened to fit that of another dark-haired, beardy unkempt kid walking by.   (I know I'm making myself sound old here, but I've reached my third decade and I feel I've earned it, I have worked in the service industry and it's not that hard to provide the minimum level of service and courtesy).

FINALLY, Antonio appeared, perfunctorily provided the check and finally gratefully we were on our way.

I wanted to complain to management, but I never saw any, and based on some other reviews, I doubt it would have accomplished anything.  It seems management is going out of their way to teach bad manners to the waitstaff.

Oh and the gimmick of being in an old church with pretty stained glass windows and brewery equipment where the altar once was, wears off real quick.   

First and last time here.  Ruined our night and put a sour taste in our mouth after a day which had been fun up until this stop.  Not only will we NEVER go back here, we won't be buying their beers at any distributor ever again.    Do not come here on a special occasion, in fact, don't waste your time or money here at all.   There are plenty of other awesome microbreweries opening up who will be serving food, and eventually may put this dump out of business.",0,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,0,1,1/4/2014,review,8,,"Really wish I had read some of the 1-2 star reviews before planning my fiance's birthday dinner here, which I had intended to be the perfect ending to a fun day touring Pittsburgh's breweries.

I will say this, it is not the Church Brew that I remember.

The beers are OK- from their usual rotation to whatever sort of seasonal they are churning out. I had the Millenium Trippel, and my girlfriend had the coconut stout. Both were reasonable.

Our appetites were slavering, having just circumnavigated the downtown looking for somewhere to park for the Jazz festival, yet leaving maligned due to the usual parking issues of downtown Pgh during an event. On the way back, we figured we had not been to Church Brew in a long time, so it would be just the ticket. 

They had an insert with southern/ creoleish dishes as the specials. This really got my tastebuds raring to go, as I love spicy southern food. To start, we had the alligator peirogies, and for entrees, the Cubano, and the Pulled Pork.

The peirogies were tasty enough, but I really did not get anything related to an alligator out of that. Hide I been blind, or blindfolded, I would have assumed they were regular peirogies with a bit of chutney on top. 

My girlfriends Cubano was a huge disappointment. This is the second time we have tried to get a Cuban Sammich somewhere and left thinking ""WTF"".  This sandwich is about 1) Well toasted bread 2) A good slathering of mustard 3) an evenly spread layer of crunchy pickle and 4) meat.

In that order. 

My pulled pork was flavorful, but no world beater by any stretch, and was paired with rice and beans minus anything to complement them in terms of flavors. Dont get me wrong, I think those ingredients go together, but some extra spices or textures would have made the dish superb.",0,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,0,2,6/10/2013,review,1,,"I have been to Church Brew Works several times over the years, and must have never yelped about it.

1. The brewery is located in a gorgeous church. I mean, it is really really pretty. The novelty of eating & drinking in a church is pretty great. 

2. The brews served up are so delicious they could make a monk cry. If you love a good local brewery with a consistently good reputation, church brew works is a shining star. Fortunately, the brews are bottled & you can buy them around town in cases & six packs. I have drank multiple sampler cases of all their various ales, ipas, ambers and stouts, and loved every single one of them - that's saying a lot. I can be particularly hateful about subpar beer. 

Cons; 
1. The wait staff appears to be trained in assholism, to a degree that I have often been discouraged from going here. Too many times I have left swearing never to return for the abuse & neglect. Once I sprained my ankle here on some slippery stairs. Instead of offering me an apology and a bag of ice, as a decent person might, or offering a number of their lawyer in the event of a personal injury liability claim, the waiter was a complete dick & tried to up-sell me on an expensive bourbon shot, ""for the pain."" 

2. Some of the food is mediocre, but none of it is a good value. I am a person who loves garlic, but you have to wonder why you can't taste any other flavors in so many of their dishes. The food is overpriced without a quality to back the price tag. They have a tempting ""pierogie of the day"" dish -- don't fall for it, it is disgusting 99% of the time. If you have to eat here, try one of the pizzas. Vegetarians have limited choices here. Vegans will starve. 

3. Church Brew Works brings in people who would otherwise never venture to Lawrenceville, and gives them a totally mistaken impression of the neighborhood. This is not a place where you befriend folks at the next table. The majority of people here are not like you. And you should be happy you are not like them. 



Despite all this, it is a really really pretty church! Good place to impress parents & in-laws from out of town. Office ladies who live in the suburbs will eat this up. Your wait staff is likely to deserve less than a 10% tip, but if you are like me, you will be guilted into leaving at least 15% because the universal good tip karma requires that you pay it forward.",2,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,2,1,10/9/2008,review,3,,"Pros:

And walking through those thick wooden doors, Church Brew Works still retains the elegant, ornate beauty of a church, with pews as booths and the alter being home to the brewery equipment. A lot of the original stained glass is there too. It's breathtaking.

One drawback to the atmosphere is the constant echo of conversations. It can difficult to hear people talking at your table if it's busy.

Service is good, but it can be damn slow, especially if anyone at your table orders a wood fired pizza. Expect at least a 30-minute wait from the time you order. They're tasty, but a pain if you want to get in and out fast. Pierogi fillings are often novelty and overpriced. (I think at one point they had shark meat stuffed ones?) Not my favorite when there are many, more traditional pierogi options in the city.

Sandwiches are OK and desserts are decent, particularly the bread pudding. I ordered the seasonal pumpkin bread pudding to share and it was awesome. It was very decadent with layers of flavor.

I've never had the beer, but they also brew pop. I once was a huge fan of the birch beer, similar to a root beer, but the quality has gone down over time. It was once more flavorful; it's tasted more watered down during more recent visits. They usually brew one other pop. One time it was cherry soda. Another time it was cream soda.

The pro:  
 - Service is good.  Attentive, prompt, friendly and very competent.  Even on a VERY crowded Saturday night when the place was absolutely packed. 

The con:
 - Bland and poorly done food.  The soup was tasteless.  The bison rib-eye was all gristle.  Wilted lettuce on the salad and if there was ANY dressing on it, I couldn't taste it.  The fries were typical dive-bar fare.  The only exception were the two pizzas at our table.  Both were very good.  

So I guess if you're looking for great beer and tasty pizza, this is your place.  If you want good food, done well, head somewhere else.

u4sQTg5gH1SQGIN6XlQRKA,D2BIq4W9j3Jej94-ynFcmg,"What a cool place to eat and drink!  My Pittsburgh trip was guided by Yelp, and I ended up at an old Catholic church.... ready to drink a lot of beer.  This website really is useful.

We showed up right in the thick of the Friday dinner rush and had a 30 minute wait.  Our server was very friendly and told us all about the beer and food menus.  If you are feeling like a sandwich instead of an entree, be sure ask for the pub menu. 

I got the cuban sandwich, and my wife got the bbq sandwich.  Both were okay, but not great.  The beer was pretty much the same.  I got the hefeweizen (and later on a dunkel) and my wife got one of the beers on special.  Again, it was just okay.  Maybe it was just the night I went, but the beer wasn't that cold at all.  I know a little more than the average bear about beer, and that some beers are meant to be served at certain temperatures.... but it just seemed like it should have been served colder.  Again, maybe it's just me.... maybe I got there right as they tapped a new keg.  Maybe they poured my beer in a glass fresh out of the dishwasher.  I don't know.

The real appeal of this place is the structure housing it.  You sit there catching yourself looking up a lot of times during your meal.  I was struck wondering about the history of the place.  Not when it was built, or anything like that, but of all the weddings, baptisms and funerals had taken place here.  How many joyous and sad times.

So, to recap: Service - Very good, Food - OK, Beer - OK, Location - Great.

I did try their wine and I was pleased with bottle pricing and taste so if you are just looking to make a pit stop for a drink consider this a 3 star review. If youa re looking to eat pass this place up. A couple of basic issues first there is little to no parking neighborhood or in the lot in the back if you are going on a weekend night so plan ahead. This is ok I can deal with it if I love the place, second I was supposed to be seated with a large group but my friend and I would have been split up due to the pew seating. This was ok it was our fault for being late. We chose to sit in the bar instead of wait for our own table. So we get in the bar and service at a table was super slow we get our wine within 10-20 minutes of sitting which is fine but I think the food took 55 minutes for two sandwiches. The food was just bleh not high on taste after that wait and the hype I have heard I was hoping for more. But it is just another chain resaurant hiding inside a church (let down). I got the philly cheesesteak sandwich my friend the crab cake because we were hoping for something quick and filling. Cheese steak was just ok bun was too big and lack of  generic cheese sauce made it dry, no sauteed onions or peppers ( again let down.) My friend had the crabcake sandwich and they had not put any sauce on it. The waitress did bring her a tiny bit of sauce as it was supposed to come with sauce. Here is the kicker the sweet potato fries we both paid  $2.00 extra on top of our 15$ sandwiches for are from Sam's club! Hahahaha I have to laugh because if you're going to serve me precooked fries which I am sure a lot of places do don't charge me extra and at least try to make sure they are wedges or something. Throw a cajun spice rub on but don't barely heat them they were super cold.... and buy them at Sam's club. If you're one of hte most hyped breweries in pgh! People notice these things lol. At least it provided me with a good laugh. So all in all 4 stars for atmosphere yea its a cool place young attractive crowd, but I am a food lover 1-2 stars for food, 3 stars for drinks. Part of town is tricky to maneuver at night. I would pass and try another brewery in town because food and beer are lovely when done properly together and maybe church brew works needs to build a better kitchen.",1,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,1,2,1/8/2012,review,1,,"Before Reading please note my review is mainly based on the service and food, as I did not try beer.

S_QSsTz9MwlYH_OGExKtGw,WQ_oAbjw4na60piAuuGacA,"After starting a new job about 2 weeks ago, my supervisor thought it would be a good idea to go out for a bite to eat and a few beers, as part of my introduction to Pittsburgh and as a way to build some rapport outside of the office.  He suggested the Church Brew Works as the venue, with the caveat that he has found their beers to be rather uneven, their food to be suitable, and the location to be quite remarkable.  I had heard about the Church Brew Works before, and I was eager to try out this restaurant.

My supervisor was correct when it comes to the beer.  I had a pint of the Heavenly Hefe Weizen, which I found to be rather mediocre.  It was a bit watery for my taste, and there was a flavor I couldn't pick out that seemed a bit off.  For our second round, we chose the Pipe Organ Pale Ale.  This brew had an assertive hoppy essence that was quite enjoyable.  It was pleasantly bitter, and definitely the better of the two beers that I tried.  Compared to other pale ales, though, it was simply OK.

We split the Chicken & Chorizo Pizza, which was quite good.  The crust acquired a nice flavor in the brick oven and was crispy.  Toppings were fresh, although I found the grilled chicken to be underseasoned and the chorizo to be a bit bland as well.  I was expecting a spicier sausage.  On the whole, though, the pizza was good.  It was the perfect amount of food for two strapping young men to share.  At $15.50, I thought the price was fair for the amount and quality of food.

The real star at the Church Brew Works is the building.  It is clearly a unique setting, and it was a lot of fun to enjoy a few beers at this location.  For a Wednesday evening, it was quite busy so they have clearly built up a following.

My issue is with the food prices.

As two people who love irony, my husband and I thought after eloping in Allegheny County Night Court, there would be no better place to have a ""reception"" than a church converted into a brewery. It's a cool space and worth a visit, though it is packed on weekend evenings.

My favorite on the dinner menu -- chicken pot pie! I love that it's not thick and goopy and that the topper is puff pastry and not traditional pie crust. On the pub menu -- LOVE the Southwest Chicken Wrap and traditional pierogies. Husband is a fan of the salmon. 

I am giving it a 4 because the service has never been stellar -- typically if you're not sitting at the bar, you have to ask for the pub menu, which has pizza and sandwich options. I don't really get that -- because it's pretty much the old center aisle of the church that divides the bar side from the ""dining room"". But I have gotten a surly hostess (same one) on two occasions. No real greeting, no eye contact. So yeah, if you can get past that, the food is always spot on and tasty in my experience.

Oh! And the smell, it is distinctive. It doesn't bother me -- however, if you're turned off by woody, earthy smells -- you might want to skip.

Hehe, update -- another Yelper read this review and messages me that they actually changed their menu several months ago and don't have Chicken Pot Pie.

Someone told me that Church Brew Works is one of those places you must take out of town visitors. It took me two and a half years to see the place for myself, but I have to agree. It's beautiful with its stained glass windows and high ceilings, but it doesn't take itself too seriously.

I enjoyed the two brews we tried, the Celestial Gold and the Pious Monk. The traditional pierogies we had as an appetizer were also great. The service was friendly and prompt, and our waiter saved our party of two from making a huge mistake and ordering a pizza AND another entree. Don't do this. One pizza for two people is plenty. It could probably feed three people just fine.

Unfortunately, this place slips into 3-star territory with its pizza. We split the Southwestern, which had a chipotle-tomato sauce, corn, cheese, and red onion. Interesting flavor combo, but the pie should have been cooked longer. The center of the pie was also too thin, which meant that the tip of each slice always fell apart when I tried to pick the slice up and eat it.

Sitting down with us was one of the brewers, Justin Viale. Justin was a lot of fun to be with and his sharing of his brewing knowledge and CBW experience added to the evening. The chef, Joe Kiefer, came out with each course to explain it. Great job, Joe.

Their beers are good. Their hefeweizen and (currently) their coconut stout are exceptional.

Everything else? Sort of underwhelms me. The food is pricey but the quality is sub-par. I've been there several times in the last year, and tried everything from the soups to the sandwiches to the pizza. 

Yesterday I had the lobster bisque, some of my friend's thai wings, and a slice of the mushroom pesto pizza. The bisque wasn't worth the $7 I paid for it. The wings were good, but not great. I thought the pizza was salty and rather bland tasting overall.

I've had other pizzas that were better in the past (from the CBW), but again. They aren't anything spectacular.

It took a while for beers to be replenished and in one incident she said that they were replacing the tap for the IPA and when we followed-up with her about it when no beer arrived 15 minutes later, she said she would ask but then stopped herself and said that she remembered they ran out...What?!?!  I was thinking to myself at what point where you going to mention that and that's an important detail to remember when there's a table of thirsty individuals waiting for beers.

Relative to beer, Church took a major hit when its head brewery ran down the street to open his own gig (on my list of beers to try!).  Thus far, it seems like the quality of their brews hasn't been majorly affected, but CBW is one of those places that I either absolutely love or absolutely hate their beer.  A monthly rotating ""blast furnace stout"" (different flavors/methods of brewing) always presents an interesting drink, and their Cherry Quadzilla is good if you like fruity interpretations of Belgians.  Thunderhop IPA is that staple of the bunch, and a good representation of the type at that.

Relative to food, Church is generally also hit or miss here too.  Most of their food is average, however their pizza (particularly the wild boar) is extremely good (just be prepared to wait an hour plus if the oven gets backed up).

veXe0b70eNJtWt4KSawZ3A,76SrbXYzgZqifekfSdCKMg,"This restaurant ruined my New Year's Eve! My husband and I made a reservation for 10pm, thinking it would be a fun place to be at midnight - we were wrong. We were told we had the table for 2 hours, and there were all sorts of rules about how you couldn't cancel or be late or else they'd charge you. We were a few minutes early, and pretty much the first thing our server said to us when we sat down was, ""Our kitchen is about to close."" Why they take reservations for 10pm if that's when the kitchen closes, I can't imagine. So, we quickly put in our order (we both wanted their special New Year's Eve 3 course prix fixe menu), and continued to be rushed through the entire meal. 

The appetizer was disappointing - my husband ordered Fried Goat Cheese and the portion was so teeny tiny; the cheese pieces were about the size of a dime. I had the Cioppino, which was supposed to be mussels, scallops, and shrimp in a lobster-saffron broth. There was no shrimp, and the mussels and scallops were so miniature that they had no flavor whatsoever. The broth and garlic bread were good.

While we were still eating our appetizers they brought out the soup/salad course, which is so rude and made us feel rushed. My husband's Lobster Bisque was good, but again, very small portion. I had the Roasted Cauliflower Salad, which turned out to be an arugula salad, garnished with a few small shavings of cauliflower.

Again, while we were still eating our soup/salad, they brought out our entree, and by that time we were pretty annoyed and asked if they could keep the entrees hot while we finished our current course. Our server was visibly impatient/annoyed and said that her manager didn't want our entrees in the window, but agreed to bring them back anyway. When we were finished and she brought our entrees back out they were lukewarm. The flavors were good, but would have been much better if prepared/served at the appropriate time.

Then we asked to see the dessert menu and our server said no, the kitchen is closed. We asked to speak to the manager. Miraculously, the kitchen was not actually closed. We had dessert - my Malted Bread Pudding was good, but my husband's Carrot Cake was way too gingery.

Through each course, the staff was cleaning around us, making us feel even more rushed, and we couldn't even have a normal conversation because they were hovering so much. Our server was acting like she couldn't wait for us to leave.

When we were finished and it was time to pay, the manager finally came out. He glazed over the whole issue and did not listen to our complaints. By that time we felt so unwelcomed, we just wanted to get out of there. So, we were actually driving home when the clock struck midnight. So disappointing!

A manager contacted us after we posted our Yelp review and offered us a gift certificate to entice us to give them a second chance (see my previous review for the whole story of how bad the experience was). Nice move! Restaurants should take note that this is the correct practice for ""service recovery"". Unfortunately, they botched their second chance.

The manager recognized us, even though we didn't mention we were there for service recovery. He apologized about our prior bad experience and thanked us for giving them another try. We did not see him again after that.

While we were in the middle of eating our appetizers, our server brought out the entrees again, saying ""I didn't want them to get cold""! That's the exact same thing that was the problem last time! Are you telling me that you know that we're in there explicitly to give you a second chance because of poor service on our prior visit, at your insistence, and then you go ahead and do the exact same thing that we complained about in the first place? That is the one thing they should have had figured out this time. Also, it's not like we're particularly slow eaters or anything.

They don't seem to understand: the food is going to die on the table just the same as it will die on the pass. The point of coursing a meal is so that we get the entrees at the right temperature when we're ready to eat them. If you don't want the entrees to die, don't fire them so soon. This is basic food service stuff, folks.

5_GNc6DHiOOSH47ZjmOG_Q,dH0ZJpPzu9FjINS0uoPiUg,"Despite the disaster that was my break up with my ex last summer, I still keep coming back to the place we first met in person- CBW! I ridiculously love their Thunderhop IPA and it is always my go-to beer if none of the seasonal varieties peak my interest. I'm not a fan of the Celestial Gold but my (new-er) bf, who is not much of a beer drinker and prefers wine or mixed drinks, enjoyed it and said it's ""perfect for non-beer drinkers"". Since I last reviewed any of the menu options, I have sampled a lot, hence the need for an update! 
As far as apps go, the Spinach, feta, and smoked gouda dip is  great for sharing and has that oozy, cheesy ""comfort"" taste to it. This is always a winner in my book, particularly because gouda and feta are my two favorite types of cheeses. The chips are, well, just chips. Maybe warmed pita bread would be a tastier substitution to the chips in the future. The bruschetta is also a solid appetizer to share. The ratio of toppings to bread (which usually annoys me when ordering bruschetta because I constantly feel like I'm left with either a lot of topping and no crostinis or the exact opposite) is perfect!
 In addition to the wild boar BBQ pizza (which will always be my favorite pie at CBW), I've also had the pleasure of enjoying the Artichoke, spinach, and feta pizza and the chicken and sundried tomato pizza. Both were very flavorful and served pipping hot right out of the oven. The ingredients were very fresh and evenly distributed throughout the pie. The sundried tomato pizza I enjoyed actually was ""on the house"" because the bartender (such a quirky guy but well-meaning) clearly forgot to ring in the order (the big clue was when it had been 25 minutes and he asked what we had ordered again). Being the pizzas here are a bit on the pricey end, I greatly appreciated this generosity particularly considering the inconvenience as well. 
I've also had the opportunity to sample some of their sandwiches, and I was pretty impressed with those as well! I've tried the Buffalo burger, the chicken and brie sandwich, and the pulled pork sandwich. The buffalo burger, cooked to a perfect MR, was so flavorful in it's natural juices that I did not use any condiments or have any add ons (like bacon or sauteed mushrooms or onions-perhaps next time since all of a sudden that sounds amazingly delicious!) With the chicken and brie sandwich, I loved how the brie complimented the granny smith apple slices on the sandwich! It was cheesy yet not overly so-very delicious! The pulled pork sandwich was very tasty too-particularly the BBQ sauce which I believe to be the same used on the Wild boar BBQ pizza!

I ended up here with a party of 12, celebrating a co-worker's impending move to California. I ordered the grilled salmon with polenta, and it was ok. Again, nothing special, until I took my second bite of polenta and felt something crunch in my mouth. Since polenta is not supposed to be crunchy, I did a double take and took the crunchy thing out, rather than swallow it. This turned out to be an excellent decision because the crunchy thing was actually a piece of glass. Not only that, but when I cut into the middle of the polenta again (on the grounds of ""this merits further investigation"") I found *another* piece of glass! Right there in the middle! Not huge shards (about the size of my pinky nail) but big enough to cut internally if swallowed. My co-workers and friend that I was with were all witnesses to this.

I'll give CBW credit for handling this about the way you're supposed to: as soon as I told the waiter, he told the manager, who came over and was super apologetic. Obviously comped my meal (I got replacement food) and drinks, and offered me dessert to take home. That's great and all, but even greater would have been just not finding glass in my food. I can see a completely different scenario where I accidentally swallow it and have internal injuries, or even just cut up my mouth; that story doesn't end happily for anyone involved.

Went with a group of 5 and everyone liked their drink. Had the beer sample flight, which was fun. It allows you to try their more popular beers before deciding on one to commit to. People in my group liked it. I'm not a beer fan, so I had a mango sangria, which was tasty. They do have a good number of non-beer choices for those who aren't beer fans. We also got two pizzas that were pretty scrumptious.

The beer was really great-- I tried a dark wheat and an amber, both really excellent.  We had pirogies, which seem to be popular around the area, and they were really excellent.  I then moved onto a pasta dish with different veggies in a light tomato sauce which was really great too.

First things first: a big thank you to Pitt Yelper Kat M. for suggesting husband and I come here on our trip to the 'Burgh.  You were right, we loved Church Brew Works!

If you're at all sensitive about your religious iconography, this might not be the place for you.  This former Catholic church -- St. John the Baptist -- was once a well attended congregation which slowly dwindled as the steel mills closed and residents moved out of the neighborhood.  Eventually the Diocese decided to close St. John's doors, sent a priest to desanctify the building, and put it up for sale.  In 1996, after three years of construction (during which the original building and fixtures, including floors, pews, and stained glass windows were carefully restored or preserved), Church Brew Works microbrewery and restaurant opened it doors.  While some of the former congregants are unhappy with this holy conversion, for the most part CBW has been quite well received not only in the neighborhood, but by Pittsburghers on the whole.  [We got all this helpful info from our excellent server -- good on CBW for educating its servers about the history of the church and brewery.  You *know* these questions come up often.]

For two heathens like husband and me, downing tasty microbrews in a church pew overlooking beer tanks occupying a former altar is nothing short of a religious experience.  We enjoyed the Pious Monk Dunkel, Paganator Doppel Bock, Thunder Hop IPA, Millennium Trippel, and a special brew for their Caribbean-themed kick-off-to-summer celebration, Coconut Stout.  CBW makes some mighty fine brews.  Husband also had an order of their housemade pierogi.  The flavor of the day was alligator and plantain with a spicy mango sauce.  CBW is such a different place, the kind of spot you wish would open up in your own neighborhood.  

Our brewery, which art in Pittsburgh, hallowed be thy name.  Forever and ever.  Aaaaa-men.",8,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,7,4,6/5/2011,review,11,,"How much fun is this place?!?  I'll tell you.  It's loads of fun.

What is special, like the other reviewers point out, is the venue. Set in a former church, the owners were wise in leaving the stained glass in place and in turning the alter into the location of a micro-brewery. And the brew is definitely worth it. They have a selection of staples that are all quite tasty and also rotate some seasonals in. I forget the one I tried, but it was delicious...and I'm not even a big beer drinking.

59A-ZxUMOgIl2MAnySh-Aw,23Bx-HKn1N8rXW_fziWskw,"I wish I could post separate reviews for the beers and the experience. The beer is great. It's fresh. Based on the quality, I presume CBW is a craft brew pub. There is an interesting selection of rotating beers. I will definitely attempt to acquire more CBW beer in the future; unfortunately, I don't think it will be at this venue.

To start, it took about 10 minutes to get the attention of one of the bartenders. That's just too long especially when everyone is ordering just beer. Also, the bartender brought us the wrong beers. We ordered the belgian tripels, and he be brought us american barleywines. I should have noticed from the color and said something immediately, but I decided to give it a shot with the likely chance that I was wrong. Upon tasting, my suspicion was confirmed; however, I really enjoyed the style, so I didn't ask the bartender to correct it. I'm glad I tried something new, yet it shouldn't have happened this way.

The atmosphere is very similar to Hofbrauhaus'. It's very loud with a eclectic clientele; similar to Hofbrauhaus, there are many family casually dining. one big difference is that no one is dancing on their seat. I would also assert that folks here appear to be less drunk which I'd attribute to the smaller serving glasses.

D4UtG6k4Y_T7_xsvj8zDkw,kdvoNmc_zuK8ieMK0PUybA,"Once we got over the fact that we were in a church-turned-brewery... the whole gimmick faded and we realized that this was a pretty sub-par restaurant.

First off, this two star rating is due to the food and service. I hesitated giving it a 3-star because the beers were pretty good. But we're in Pittsburgh and by default, good beers are expected.

- The waiter our group got was seriously one of the worst waiters I have ever gotten. The moment we sat down, our waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything to drink in a tone of ""I do not want to be here."" We asked if he could have a moment to look at the menu because it was our first time and asked for one more menu. He walked over to a table with a cute couple and took the menu right off their table and gave it to me without asking the other couple if they were done with it. He then stormed off and didn't come back till way later. When we were ordering food, he gave us attitude for everything and was extremely rude. My friend asked a question and he answered with a sarcastic remark and walked to the next person, never bothering to actually wait or answer the question honestly. When we got our checks, he threw them onto our table. I was extremely annoyed by his attitude towards us, which started before we even spoke to him. I understand that you have bad days and just don't want to deal with anyone, but that is no way to act to someone who is trying their best not to anger you and now completely confused as to why you are treating them like crap. Anywho... rant over. Bleh.

- The pizza was alright. A little dry and not super unique. I felt like it was missing something in flavor. The portions were huge, however.

- I got two beers, the Rotating Stout (which is actually a light beer brewed with coffee and chocolate) and the Dunkel. The Rotating Stout was certainly unique, it didn't have the heavy, silky finish of real stouts, but had it's own unique, refreshing tart with aftertastes of coffee. The Dunkel was smooth and not super strong, again, a good beer to drink. Both beers were great and decently priced, but I would not come back just for the beers when there are other great beer places in Pittsburgh.

The only reason why I would come back is if I had run out of things to show visiting friends or they saw this on a flyer and HAD to see it. Otherwise, there are so many other unique, amazing things in Pittsburgh that I would love to show friends and family.

Tonight I had the meatloaf.  I'm not a big fan of meat loaf, but as is one of their signature dishes so I thought I'd try it.  Ugkh!  The entire meal was incredibly salty, way over salty.  I mean borderline inedible.  The meatloaf itself was dry and not appealing and the rest of the plate just went down hill from there. 

My wife had the Salmon.  Salmon is usually a pretty safe dish, but in this case it was again, a little dry and just not appetizing.   However, the it came with similar sides to the meatloaf and bam there goes the saltiness again.

Our three kids had three different meals, hard to screw up pasta or perogies or pizza.  Well you would think, except the pizza arrived a good 5 minutes after the other meals, was overcooked and again heavily salted.  

All in all we want to like this place.  The staff are always friendly, as they were again tonight, and I'll admit to having a soft spot for their Celestial Gold, but we may have to take a break for a while.  Been stung once too often lately to be going back anytime soon.

Well, I'm not sure where sampling beers on a Sunday afternoon at a micro-brew located in a former Catholic church necessarily fits in the whole scheme of things, but I felt I was violating some type of rule, code or commandment. Regardless, Church Brew Works had been at the top of my Pittsburgh to-do list since I heard about it last summer and I was checking it out, regardless.

Since I've never tried their beer before, I decided to order the sampler, consisting of eight different 5oz brews for $12.75. But after doing some quick math, I realized I needed to address my growling stomach first to avoid any unintentional purge-atory (rim shot). After looking through the variety of menu options, I decided on the lunch version of the Garden Plum Tomato brick-oven pizza. Aside from being crispy and tasty, it turned out to be the perfect size for one person.

Anyway, back to the beer. Sorry. There were four year-round samples consisting of Celestial Gold, Pious Monk Dunkle (+), Blast Furnace Stout (+) and Pipe Organ Pale Ale. There were also four seasonal brews consisting of Red Nebyllek, Coffee Dunkel (+), Thunder Hop and Oktoberfest (+). It was a great mix of all different types: light, dark and everything in between.

Regarding the interior, I love how they've kept the original structure, including the pews, fixtures and woodwork, mostly the same. Plus, you can walk up center aisle, which divides two separate dining areas, to the front of the church where large, copper brew tanks sit on the front altar. It's sort of weird, yet cool, to see.

Spending lunch here was a fun and pleasant experience and I was glad to see so many other people ""congregating"" here as well. Okay, okay, I'm done.

The pulled pork was ok...but once again, topped with almost no slaw, and very, very skimpy on the sauce.  The final nail in the coffin was the fries.  They were so cold, I couldn't even touch them.

The ambiance is even worse!  Just a dull, loud hum for the entirety of your meal, in a space that seems like they're just jamming you in wherever they can fit you.  I asked if they could turn on some music, and I was told there was music playing.  Whats the points?!

Service was friendly, but inattentive.  This was probably the only thing I could say was decent about the meal, because even though she didn't really check on us very often, she seemed busy, so it's understandable.

The ambiance is even worse!  Just a dull, loud hum for the entirety of your meal, in a space that seems like they're just jamming you in wherever they can fit you.  I asked if they could turn on some music, and I was told there was music playing.  Whats the points?!

Service was friendly, but inattentive.  This was probably the only thing I could say was decent about the meal, because even though she didn't really check on us very often, she seemed busy, so it's understandable.

But yeah, I won't be returning to Church Brew Works., nan",2013-05,,17,"['1zJL9PogiFyd_NhGcbgs7Q', '7--UNhd8jumkF3b0eC93cQ', 'xMAkjQDQBH-N0EfhegaOXA', 'y9xFfMQ7-1UQJc4VYy8q8A', 'nEYPahVwXGD2Pjvgkm7QqQ', 'MeMYKxFgU_dJaxNsee89yg', 'JbAeIYc89Sk8SWmrBCJs9g', 'SLierwYJc62TIZG-CCokSg', 'vYkqkhsEtp1BjrDU-y6K5A', 're4_1i9huzTj8nTuoaWHmw']",,,0,,user,,,,3.47,,[],Justin,5,,9,,1,15,FALSE,,TRUE,16:00,TRUE,,,FALSE,16:00,FALSE,TRUE,full_bar,FALSE,,TRUE,FALSE,,16:00,FALSE,"['Bars', 'American (Traditional)', 'Nightlife', 'Restaurants']",TRUE,16:00,Church Brew Works,FALSE,FALSE,no,,FALSE,,TRUE,2,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,656,,PA,TRUE,0:00,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,"3525 Liberty Ave

Location/Building: 5/5 Beautiful. Unique. Interesting. Very open and airy. A distinct smell of yeast and a mix of delicious food smells.

Service: 2.5/5 I'm horribly disappointed by our reservation not being a reservation at all and really rushing our meal which had originally intended to go from around 8pm - 10pm.

Food: 2/5 While it was not bad food by any means, for the price I could make entire meals with far more flavor. The portions were big, but even big portions of mediocre food isn't all that great.

Beer: 5/5 Outstanding. I will definitely be back for more beer, and maybe I'll allow the food another pass. 

The details:

I went to the Church Brew Works for the first time last night. I pass it twice a day 5 days a week and I've been curious for ages as to this fabled fine eatery and brew house within a church. I have to say though, maybe my expectations were too high. 

The entire point of going was for a friend's birthday gathering. An initial party of maybe 15. She had called days ahead and they said they could accommodate us. Upon arriving we were told it wasn't actually a ""reservation"" so much as a ""request."" Regardless of the fact that we had told them how many, what day, and the exact time DAYS in advance. After sitting for 15 minutes we down graded the party to 12 as some people hadn't shown. We grabbed some Pumpkin Stouts and waited another 30 minutes before downgrading to the 9 of us that had shown up and we still waited nearly 10 minutes more. 

Being under some time constraints this really put a damper on the evening. Although after the almost 50 minute wait we walked through the restaurant which is lovely with gorgeous high ceilings, a festive air, and a glass wall behind the altar through which you can see some of the brewing happening. We were seated on the altar which provides an amazing view of the entire restaurant. Our waiter was efficient, friendly, and apologetic for the wait. We had quick service and refills as often as we needed them. The food though, this is where I was really turned off from ever coming back for a meal. 

They have two menus; a regular and a pub menu. The regular is very pricey and the pub menu is moderate to somewhat pricey. We all ended up ordering from the pub menu and while the food tasted good I don't think it was worth the 8$ - 12$ a pop.

I went back after a lackluster first experience (summed up by ""liked the beer, hated the food""), I thought their menu looked great, and figured I'd try it again. To start, the service was awful. While FOUR hosts/servers chatted about their weekends, we waited about 10 minutes by the ""wait to be seated"" sign, until we finally flagged someone down.

We ordered appetizers, bruschetta and a lentil mushroom ball. Both were very tasty! Our friends ordered sangria (delicious), and cask ale (also very good).

Which art in barrels, 
Hallowed be Thy drink, 
Thy will be drunk, 
At home as I am in the tavern...

Ok, now that that's over with I do have to say this is by far the coolest brewpub I've ever been to. Granted, it's a long way away in PA, but thankfully I get to take regular trips to get my pierogi and church fix. 

Not like I really needed a church fix.

Anyway, here's my lowdown:
- Get the beer sampler and then choose the beer you want. That is, of course, if you don't already live in Pittsburgh and don't know what the hell kind of beer they brew.

- Then get the IPA. It's hoptastic.

- Order some pierogies. There are two types - unusual and usual. Why get usual? Go for the unusual.

- Then there's a pierogi pizza. If you're getting the pierogi appetizer you probably don't need a whole pizza. But I'm real tempted to go back and try it because honestly, pierogi pizza. Some Italian Russian is spinning in his grave.

- Skip the pulled pork sandwich and beer cheese. Neither is all that good or special or memorable.

Oh - and make sure you use the bathroom. I don't know about the men's room, but the ladies is awesome. It's like a choir green room in a bar! A BAR IN A CHURCH! AH!!!!!!

The service is sometimes spotty, but the servers are doing the best they can and are good about communicating about delays. There is one bartender who is kind of a jerk.

The ambiance is great. It's a stunning location that was the neighborhood's Catholic church for years. The stained glass windows are especially great. For those of you complaining about the smell - it's a brewery! That's what it smells like when they are brewing.

I love it!  The huge stained glass windows, pipe organ, beer!  It's pretty awesome to look at, and it has great food and beer.

Ok beer first.  I did the Celestial Gold.  It's a pilsner beer, that tastes like a lighter version of Magic Hat's #9.  So, yeah, pretty darn good!

For a starter I had the Cajun Risotto Fritters, chorizo, peppers, onions and cheese fried with a spicy sauce.  They were very good.  For my entree I had the Shinkasa Cheesesteak .  It was Kobe beef with peppers (no onions for me) and provolone.  The sandwich was perfect.  Delicious and not greasy.  Overall it was a great experience.

Wine never does. And not only was my brew delicious it was priced right, my 2 fantastic pints were between $2.50 and $4.50 and both on point. 

So as far as grub... It was way overpriced. We had Pierogies, which from my understanding are unique to the Burgh, they were delicious for four $3.25 for potato and cheese and $7.00 for Sausage and sauerkraut which was amazing. I had the Jambalaya which was pretty good, but not $18.00 good. So while the food and drink was good the price needs help, at least on the food. 

Beautiful Church by they way I hope you heathens enjoy drinking your wicked brew in it as much as I did.",2,bwu0cUZfksuu-uzTPrrl2A,2,4,9/27/2011,review,3,,"Is there anything more wrong their drinking beer at church?

Food: 4

I think I was the only person who really loved my meal, which made me sad. Our appetizers (pierogi of the day and risotto fritters) weren't that great so I wasn't expecting anything amazing from my dinner. I ordered the cranberry, turkey and brie sandwich. It did not disappoint! It's one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, but the fries were less than tasty.

Friends shared the southwest pizza and said it was so spicy it was inedible. Normally I would say it's too bad they ordered something spicy and it was too spicy, but the menu didn't even mention it being spicy or they wouldn't have ordered it! Other friend had the PGH style salad, about which she didn't have much to say and the boyfriend had the Cubano and said it was mediocre at best (surprising, as he loves Cubans and they're rarely bad).

The ambiance was awesome! I loved how evil it felt to eat in a one-time church that was used to brew and serve beer and spirits. It's really pretty inside, and has a nice feel.

The German-style beers I had were watery, too sweet or too lemony. Pretty disappointing considering since they're a brewery! Maybe I'm just too demanding, maybe I'm just like my father (couldn't help myself) when it comes to German-style beers.

Our server was so rushed that I felt badly for her. There should have been someone from management helping her with her tables. It was probably just an off night, but it was a little disappointing nonetheless.

XM8xoYr14IaiZ7gLQ9ARpw,HyfuAfsFYyfetDFIIgFb1Q,"Church Brew Works is just cool. 

I love these church converts into new and different uses. Takes a beautiful structure and breathes new life. Church Brew Works is a large, open hall of eating and drinking. And drinking many fine brews. I really love CBW beer, and often buy cases at local beer distributors. 

So aside from the interior awesomeness of the church, there is ample outdoor seating that is just lovely in the nicer weather. Atmosphere-check.

The food is very good, but in my opinion a little pricy. The best deals are sandwiches or their wood fired pizzas. But still a couple things bother me. Like if you want sweet potato fries with your sandwich - its a $2 up-charge. But if you look at the prices on the side orders menu the price difference of regular fries to sweet potato fries is only $1.50. It just kinda makes it seem like they are trying to get more money from you than is justified by their own menu. Another example would be that the lunch serving and dinner serving of Jambalya are something like $8 in difference but the portion size does not change or is negligible. Just doesn't seem right. 

Aside from the pricing everything I have has there is very good. A lot of good drinking food...hearty, and very often interesting. 

Service is really good here. One time we had to wait before someone got to our table, and we were comped some drinks. I thought it was really good customer service, very appreciated. 

This is a good place for large groups, also a good place to bring visitors who might appreciate good local beer.

Plus: The vegetarian options were delicious and the brick oven pizzas were great.

Minus: Our waitress was absentee and forgot our waters and my drink when bringing the rest of the tables' drinks. It just seemed like there were too few waiters for such a huge restaurant

Overall, the food and beer make it a great place to bring visiting beer fans, but they could make some minor adjustments to make it a place we'd like to go on a regular basis.

Plus: The vegetarian options were delicious and the brick oven pizzas were great.

Minus: Our waitress was absentee and forgot our waters and my drink when bringing the rest of the tables' drinks. It just seemed like there were too few waiters for such a huge restaurant

Overall, the food and beer make it a great place to bring visiting beer fans, but they could make some minor adjustments to make it a place we'd like to go on a regular basis.

ApYIFJh2L0yce4sqILrtYw,ToWfy1eoniaxTkMvIu4qYQ,"The Church Brew Works in the former St. John the Baptist church on Liberty Ave is one of my absolute favorite restaurants anywhere.  I've been here for lunch, dinner, happy hours, and special events (birthdays and wedding rehearsal dinners).  I don't even know where to begin.

They keep the place immaculate, and there really is no pun intended here.  It's gorgeous.  The atmosphere is unique, one could even say post-modern.  I could gush about the pleasure of having a tasty meal under a vaulting, airy ceiling with sunlight streaming through the stained glass windows... so I am.  I was raised Catholic in Pittsburgh and attended both the school and the church of St. Kieran's right up the road from here and, although not particularly holy myself now, have been broken hearted by how many of the gorgeous churches in the city were shuttered by the ruthless bishop, who ironically seems to have followed me to DC...  that's to say I think shutting down the spiritual centers of the inner city when they need them the most is more sacrilegious than turning one into a gorgeous restaurant and repurposing the building.

I digress to an absurd degree...the gouda dip appetizer is to die for here.  I crave it often  it's that good.  The pizza is truly delicious, and the Pittsburgh salad with chicken and fries on top is so much better than one could ever imagine just by thinking about that combo.  I get it with ranch and use it sparingly because the chicken is so flavorful and juicy.  Really, nothing here is bad - I've had the pierogies in many of their various daily forms and could easily make meals out of them they're that good.  They're ""real"" pierogies.  Delicious.  The chicken wrap was equally delicious, though I'm not sure if it's still on the menu.  Everything is fresh and simply seasoned but still tastes very sophisticated.  I've never had a bad meal here.

The Pious Monk beer is a must.  A must!  But if you don't drink alcohol, try their birch beer or ginger ale.  They make it all right there.

The ice cream is so good - I don't remember what's special about it, they use something left over from the brewing process like the sugar or something, but this with one of their absolutely delicious cups of coffee is the perfect way to end your meal.

Amazing.  I hope you'll love it.  Another place I'd recommend without reservation to out of towners - when I bring friends home to PGH with me I take them there and no one's been disappointed.
