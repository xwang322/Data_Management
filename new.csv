When we first went in, we didn't know what to expect. So we walk in, and we are the youngest people in the establishment. Right off the back, the owner and all of the bartenders introduce themselves and pretty much cater to us. The people in the saloon are so different and there are no cliques and it's a great place to just hang out and have a drink or 20 :) 

We continue to go to nu towne at least 1-2 times a week just to stop in and say hi or see if the decorations have changed. We love all the license plates, stickers, and the random decor that makes nu towne so original.

It's basically a large shed plastered with neon beer signs, a few rainbow flags thrown in and, on Sundays, a great mixed, mostly gay crowd, all revved up for the beer bust. Great burgers and dogs, grilled right there on the patio. Friendly bartenders and beer, beer, beer and more beer.

I waited over 15 minutes to get a beer while one of the bartenders just stood there talking to someone! The only reason I got a beer was one of the other customers called Ron over. I was asked by Ron "" What do you want?""  I was taken aback by this! The customer that called Ron over said "" Oh that is just Ron""  I ordered a beer and was just handed my change. No thanks no nothing. Ron walked back to where he was standing to talk to the younger customers. That is fine if that is how you want to run a bar. My money is just as good as the next persons. A thank you would have been nice! I was told this bar is busy on sundays for beer bust. If this is how Ron treats the customers I don't think I will be back.

nc3cqVN0UuB3m50-CcMftw,ZvvTPVqChi-mQd1JV6VM5w,2008-11-23,4.0,"My first apartment in Phx was at Van Buren and 52nd streets. I'd come from a village of 500+ people and was in awe of city living. There I was, in the fifth largest city in the US, living on the same street made notorious by hookers and drug deals. Oddly enough, it was on the corner that I met my BFF, at the bus stop. But there's quite a bit more to that corner--Nu Towne Saloon. 

Back in the early 2000s, Daddy Ron ran the place and it was a den of devilish sins. Cheap beer in a smoke-filled environment called out to the horny, the lonely and the drunks. You could bet that I'd be there every Sunday for their beer busts and a few night during the week. I used to hop the fence in the parking lot to my apartment when I was too drunk to walk all the way around. And if I happened to rub up against you inappropriately back in the day, I'm blaming the dim lighting.

But now, I live in CenPho and rarely venture to my old stomping grounds. However, my BFF and I went to the swap meet at the greyhound track yesterday and I thought it would be therapeutic to drive by our old places and appreciate how our lives have turned out. This trip down memory lane included a visit to Nu Towne. A lot has changed in the past few years. That dirt overflow parking lot to the west of the bar is apartments now, and there's a street that runs along side of that. Daddy Ron is now at the Eagle (cum Retro Bar). Gone is that dark cavernous bar with the beer-sticky floors. Today, Nu Towne has undergone a metamorphosis into a swanky saloon. Natural light brightens the bar through two new windows. And existing window openings have been reclaimed. The restrooms are also bright and clean. The color scheme is decidedly more serene, the truck is gone, two new pool tables replaced to former ones with mystery stains of unknown origins and are spaced on either end of the bar, and flat-panel TVs add another layer of freshness. Although I'm not one to get excited about such things, they even have Wii events. 

So, Nu Towne has transformed from that ""It'll be our little secret"" bar to a ""Yeah, and I don't even cringe when I see my dad here"" bar. Go. Check it out. If you were here before return to see how much it's changed. If you've never been, give it a go. Don't be concerned if the parking lot isn't full--the neighbors at the apartments walk over there and can be found both inside and out of the patio., nan",3.99,Bacon,401,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",Nu Towne Saloon,"5002 E Van Buren St

Nu Towne is simple bar with a feeling of a warm inviting ""Cheers"" type place. I mean where on God's green earth does a macho bartender introduce himself when you approach the bar to buy a beer?!!

The decor, although dated, is wonderfully nostalgic. The music, one of the best parts, is both old-school (who plays The Beach Boys?!), and new catchy songs. The clientele is a mix of young-ish, middle age, and mature--all friendly, no-attitude, and inviting. Met the nicest duo (friends/biz partners). I can't remember the last time strangers invited me for a drink and were so down-to-earth. 

Suggestions: close the damn doors. I ""get"" the inviting look of open doors at places of biz, but it was too cold unless one sat in the middle of the place. I don't get why all bars do this. 

Otherwise, I'm a huge fan. Goodbye Charlie's; those of us who loathe drag shows will ""walk on by"" (I'd bet Nu Towne places Dion Warwick every now and then)., nan",3.45,Bill,116,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",Nu Towne Saloon,"5002 E Van Buren St

It's a bar so expect to find drinkers, some of them never go home, some go every day, some once a week and some like me that have been enjoying this place for 25 years!
Nutown has always been that friendly place to grab an Ice Cold Beer on the Cheap, It's always been the closest bar to ASU Main, It has always been that place with the best holiday decorations, and yes it's a great place to cruise.

What is NEW at Nu Towne is a bright new refreshed interior, uniform clad ultra freindly bartenders, and a renewed sence of community pride.

It's busy on the weekends especially Sunday afternoons, so if you go on off hours bring your own party or expect to be welcomed into conversation with the regulars and bartenders, shoot some pool, or you might just get cruised

Hungry? It's next to Honey Bears BBQ, The bartenders will fix you a corn dog, and on Sundays enjoy excellent grub on the patio. Great food & prepared to order, things like grilled chicken, steaks, burgers and chili. The procedes from The food goes to local charities and groups.

If you havnt been ever or in awhile then dont wait!!! drop in and check out whats OLD and whats New at The New Nu towne Saloon.

That about sums up the crowd at BS West - at least on 2-4-1 (yep, two for one drinks all night!) Wednesdays - their busiest night.  I'm not a big fan of this place as the crowd is pretty young and obnoxious -- drawing in my least favorite crowds:  gay ASU guys and the Scottsdale/East Valley gays.

Weekends are a bit more subdued, and might be a better time to check BS out, and on Thursdays and Sunday they do some karaoke.  Gays and karaoke?  Who would have thought.

It can be a very fun time if you go with your friends.  There's a nice loungey room upstairs with couches and a pool table (which I'm sure is fun on other days when it's not so crowded).  The music is dance/top 40 with accompanying MTV videos on the big screens.  It gets very busy, and with the north patio doors flung open, it can get downright STEAMY (and not in a good way) in there.

Since the renovation about a year ago they enlarged the dance floor, the unisex bathrooms are larger and much nicer and they added a south patio.  But it's still packed as ever as this is the only gay bar in Scottsdale, the closest gay bar to ASU and the closest one to Mesa.

I usually copy what my friends get to drink since I'm not yet an avid alcoholic, so when I asked one of the bartenders upstairs what he recommended, he steered me in the right direction to Tokyo Teas which I absolutely adore.

1. 2 for 1 drinks Wednesday and Saturdays ALL NIGHT. Yea, shut the loose hole! This is an amazing deal! Our happy hour specials are 2-4-1 until 8 or 9, if we're lucky! 

2. You know all the boys will either be here or only 2 other places on any given night. I actually think it sucks wet pussy to have to navigate 10-20 bars just to find fresh meat. (not that I ever do... but it's the principle of the thing).

3. Service is actually amazing! Drinks come to you! The bar tenders make 'em strong (especially the gal towards the smoking patio). 

4. 2 smoking patios?! NOICE. Many bars in SF require you to go outside!.. it just becomes a pain.

5. They accept card. In the event you didn't know this, many places in SF don't....

Here is why:

Disclaimer: I am a happily married straight gal, LOVE to dance techno
1- the crowd was 80% gay men, which was perfect since it meant I wasn't going to get dumb guys trying to hit on me (hello! don't you see my shiny ring AND the fact that I'm NOT dressed like a 'lady of the night' trying to get your attention) or trying to literally pull me away from my friends to dance (freak) with them.

2- the gals that were there were gay/tran/etc and not the prostitute-looking, dumb 'barely dressed' broads (as typical of lots of Scottsdale clubs) you have to deal with that take up room on the dance floor and aren't even dancing (they're just standing there trying to look hot).

3- the bartender dudes were awesome - friendly, generous with the many shots we bought and I NEVER had to 'wait' for the bartender or try to get his attention - they were very attentive and actually friendly!  ALSO, their drinks were strong! not watered down.

4- the atmosphere is fun - the place is a bit dark and dive-y looking inside (and out), but once you get the music going and the crowd thickens up, it is fun!  Also, a major thing to me - the music was perfectly amplified such that my ears were not ringing even though I was on the dance floor all night.  Also the club patrons were not like the A/R patrons.. friendlier, fun to dance with, cuter boys!  Also, since it was a bachelorette party, a lot of the gay men there were kind enough to buy the bride plenty of drinks and even take her out for plenty of dancing.

5- the owner came by and offered our bride-to-be an oh-so-sexy dance with 2 of the better looking go-go dancer dudes (I thought that was cool of the owner to set up).

I don't even club but I'd say that if I am ever invited to go clubbing again in Scottsdale, I am all for visiting this gay club!

We got lost in Old Town and had to ask where the heck this place was!  It's in the same area of Dos Gringos and Acme, actually it's kinda right behind Acme.

Acme had about a handful of people (it was already 11!), however, you could hear people talking and laughing and there we found the crowds of people in this hidden building, drinking and dancing.

$3 cover.  We had to wait about 20 minutes to get a drink.  Floor was sticky.  They did have go go boy dancers,and for me, I am totally happy with!  

I think everyone was there because it was 2-4-1...when we were getting ready to leave..I ran into my best friend's brother who is straight as can be there with his friends (male and female), just drinking away..so definitely if you want cheap drinks in Scottsdale, I would advise to go early., nan",3.72,Michele,178,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

Since I first went there way back when, it was tiny and cramped, but since then, they're redone their layout, such as their bathroom and dance floor area. Also, they're extended their patio areas which is fantastic. Love the fact that they have yummy 2-4-1 drinks with the use of their poker chips.

They still had their 2 for 1 drink chips and their go-go dancers. There was line, as usual, but I found it slow moving. And no, it's not cause there was a swarm of people filling the inside to capacity. I actually don't know why it was slow moving cause it was pretty empty for a Saturday night inside. I mean, yes, there were people out on the patios, but not that many where if they all were forced inside, would fill the place to capacity. The DJ last night I found was kind of lacking; I wanted to dance but the songs weren't really anything worth dancing to, but I do like the fact that they always take request, which leads me to another gripe. 

They changed their layout which is not really all that great. Now, I don't know if that was just for the night, but if it's not, well it's horrible. Yes, there's room and flow towards the bar but placing a dancer's platform right in front of the DJ, who takes requests, is so stupid. STUPID! I can't say it enough, considering they won't let people up there! I get not letting people go up there to dance, but not letting people up there to talk to the DJ is stupid. I'm short so I'm SOL in general in trying to talk to the DJ but my friend is taller and would be able to talk to the DJ, if the stage weren't there. And it's not like there was a dancer currently on there.

Place is still a good place to go out to and drink since they have 2 for 1's but I think it'll take more than that if I'm going to spend the whole night there.

Cp-PV8rsypbO-xBrQ6KmQg,bcBMAa0UQpNLFvvdZ4dxtQ,2007-12-13,3.0,"I wrote this in my blog on May 4 2007 - this is part 1, part 2 is in my review of Burn nightclub. Just to clarify, I'm not a gay hater or phobic or whatever in any way. This was written tongue-in-cheek. I've actually been to BS West quite a few times - my feelings about it are that it's kinda lame for a gay scene. I've seen better. It's a decent little bar though in its own right. Anyway - here's my blog as it appeared:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So last weekend was apparently 'Gay Weekend' - it was purely unintentional though.  Accidental gayness to be sure.
 
I was hanging out on Friday with my straight lesbian friend (she insists she's straight and that her girlfriend is as well - either way it gives me 'the hot,' so I don't question it) trying to show her around the cool parts of town so she doesn't decide to move pack it up and move away.  She lives in the worst and most isolated ghetto in the valley.  After moving here from a much cooler city and state, she's ready to get the fuck out of here after less than a year.  I can't really blame her.
 
Anyway - we were in downtown Scottsdale walking around and we had parked in a parking garage that was next to this tucked away gay bar called BS West.  I asked her if she wanted to go there since it was 'her people' and she did, so we did.  The first person we saw was a crossdresser (I'll get to that in a bit), and when we walked in - she made a beeline for the bathroom.  I followed and hung out near the door with my back facing the wall - trying to act casual while avoiding surprise anal rape attack.
 
She 'came out' and we got ourselves a drink and found a quiet observer spot outside so we could spy on the gays in their natural habitat.  It was mostly dudes in this place - almost no lesbians.  The guys at this place ranged from nearly middle-aged guys in hawaiian shirts, shorts and sandals to skinny young emo pretty boys. 
 
The drinks were pretty stiff, but the atmosphere was dead, so we headed out after one drink.  We accidently opened the door to a freezer or storage room instead of finding the exit... I think we were both concentrating on not getting surprise attack analy raped.  The rest of the night went on without incident.  At one point we were invited to this club called Burn in Phoenix by this girl who showed me where BS West was in the first place when I tagged along with her and the fags to her hag.  We respectfully declined, but made a mental note of the fact that we were 'missing out' on all the hot sexy single ladies.

New content: 

With regard to the mention of that first visit to BS West - it was pretty amusing actually... this was ages ago... but the first time I had met with my friend's gay pals was this night - my first visit to BS West - and we got out of the car and started towards BS West. I thought we were headed to Loco Patron where I had previously had a horrible experience and I said ""oh, fuck this - I'm not going here!"" and got all viciously adamant about it.

My friend's gay friends went through a spectrum of emotion ranging from confusion, curiosity, intolerance, and disgust. They thought I didn't want to go to BS West because it was a gay bar and that I was a horrible asshole. Once near the door and inside, I realized my mistake and spent the next half hour feeling like a shit heel and saying my sorries. I don't think I ever fully recovered from that first impression, but I'm friends with one of those guys now at least., nan",3.62,Max,402,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

For starters, the night we went (about 2 months ago) there was a $12 cover per person and there wasn't even any live music or entertainment. I still don't know what the cover was for... The bar was filthy and totally outdated, the staff were not friendly and the overall vibe was blah. 

We arrived and ordered a round of drinks. As we were sitting outside on the patio, one of the bar staff came up to our table to clear our empty drinks and mistakenly took a drink that was half full. I said something to him and about 5 minutes later the ""bar manager"" came out and asked us all to leave. We were upset and confused. Once we were outside she told us that she thought we were on ""high on drugs"" (which we weren't) and said we are not welcome back for the night. I called the next day and left a message for the owner and never got a call back to this day. Highly, highly embarrassed and disappointed. 

We went back about two weeks ago and decided to give it another shot and we still were not impressed at all. I would absolutely NOT recommend going here. Save your money or go to one of the other 65 bars in the area. That's my story..., nan",3.79,Rick,42,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

Our cocktail server was extremely efficient and attentive; it was top-notch service, especially for a busy weekend night. The drinks were a little weak, but they were on the larger side and not too expensive. One of the people in our group complained that his double Patron shots were really small and he was right. For $18 or so a pop, those shots should have been more than generous singles. 

I loved the layout of the place, the variety of seating (high tables to stand around, high bars with stools, lower tables with chairs), and the clean bathrooms. The biggest disappointment of our short time there was not getting to sing karaoke, which was going at full blast when we arrived. My husband and I each put a song in as soon as we arrived, but after 45 minutes (when everyone in our group was tired and waiting to go home), we still hadn't gotten called. I don't like when KJs don't go out of their way to welcome new singers and to insert them into the existing rotation, especially since we heard the same people sing two times in the time we were waiting to sing once. On the upside, the song list was good, the singers were above-average, and I liked the little space they had for singers to stand (eat your heart out, Apollo's!). 

Since we live pretty far from here, I probably won't be back. I'd rather spend my karaoke budget at Kobalt or Apollos. That being said, if you live close by or happen to be in the area for something else, it's a pretty lively spot with great service and talented karaoke singers., nan",3.79,Christine,263,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

I miss the land of widely accepted homosexuality that I traded for the desert.  Keep in mind, I am no gay man, but a gay woman that actually gets along with the boys.  

I first ventured to BS West for a massive birthday party and just in time to catch their drag show on a Friday or Saturday night.  From the outside it looks huge, but once you get inside don't be afraid of a little body rubbing.  The queens put on a great show and afterwards they had some heavenly looking man meat for go-go dancers take the floor in tight banana huggers. (Was that graphic enough?)

There are random TV screens strewn about upstairs and downstairs with a video going along with the music, typical.  I could say that the music selection was a little drab.  I like just a little more house and a little less Top 40 hip/hop remix.  The bartenders are quick to get your order.  The drinks aren't the strongest, but the price won't break your wallet.  That's always nice.

I have returned on 2 other occassions after discovering there are no lesbian bars in this great city.  Well, let me say lesbian bars with lesbians that don't look like your brother.

This was my first time at a Phoenix gay bar so I was excited to see what it was like. It's located in a strip mall in Old Town, which was a little surprising. I paid $5 cover and $6 for 2-4-1 Vodka Cranberries. You buy one drink and then you get a token to use later on that night. The drinks were strong and cheap - my favorite combo.

Overall, a lot of fun dance music and some hip hop, three go go dancers, and a small-medium dance floor and a ""patio"" outside. It was a fun time and I would likely return.

There was only one issue:

BEWARE!
I didn't find out about this until after we had left, but my friend charged the drink ($6) she bought on her credit card. She was told there was a $2 service charge. When she got home, she saw that she had been charged a total of $10. Since she said she did not tip - which I personally do not agree with - she didn't understand where the extra $2 charge came from. Now, I personally always tip when I buy drinks, even when it's 2-4-1 night and the second drink is technically free - I still tip on both drinks. However, I still don't think it was right for the bartender to tip himself, because that is technically committing fraud. Incredibly wrong and illegal.

For those of you who have read my reviews...know that I drink Long Island Tea and use that as a test if they do it well.  Well, I was disappointed.  I'm supposed to have a buzz before I even finish my first LIT.  After 2 LIT, no buzz.  Just give me water, honey.

However, I didn't go there to get drunk.  Hung out with a couple of friends.  Checked out the guys that were eyeing us and of course, we were gossiping like the hens we are.

I was initially concerned about keeping up with all the beautiful people of Scottsdale.  First impressions, I found it to be a little difficult to find, -sort of behind the parking garage, down an alley.  Although I'd read there was no cover charge, in fact there was one, $3.  Once inside I found it to be a quaint bar, not too many places for a stand and pose, it had good flow and a small outside patio for the smokers.  It has an upstairs loft space which I found to be a bit of a dead space; maybe best served for hanging out with a group of friends if you are not interested in the mingle.  It was 2-4-1 drinks.  I was buying; my friend had a beer and I had a mixed drink.  I was handed two different colored poker chips, (yellow and red.)  I should have asked if there was a difference.  I found out later, after having to buy a another drink, one represented beer and another mixed drinks.  Probably a no-brain-er, but I was too busy trying to figure out what BS stood for.

My first introduction to BS West was a long time ago... well long to me... back in 2005. I had been to Charlie's, and at one time there was Crowbar which is now Club Downtown. Also had been to Boom! But never heard of BS West until someone mentioned on facebook group of a gay club hidden behind Acme in Old Town. They described it as the gay club down the alley that it was hidden that anyone could easily miss it. So I went with two friends and based on pure curiousty, walked down the alley next to Acme and saw a door (pre-patio days) with a sign above it that said BS West. It was a Sat. and it wasn't too crowded but we were in awe... it was true there was an actual gay bar near Tempe. And that's how I was introduced to the 2-4-1 drink specials and the BS West chips. 

This video bar of which I think is its only kind in Phoenix and really haven't found any other video bars in other gay havens is such a nifty idea. I mean, haven't you ever been in a club and just didn't want to dance but the song is so good, that you gotta do something? well the video bar concept is awesome in that you can drink and watch the music video and kinda dance along... LOVE IT! You can never beat the drink specials here on Wed. which has always been 2-4-1 and Sat nights too. Both nights are crazy packed... that I'm sure it's against fire code but there's no restrictions... just a mass of gay men, and all kinds too, intermingle some queer peers too and it's just a great environment! Strong drinks too. But what I love apart from the drink specials are the poker chips which you can use as currency in the future. Certain colors mean certain drinks like cocktails, shots and the like. The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time, strong drinks, and just a packed atmosphere... check out BS West or BS!, nan",3.71,Jason,229,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

I had my fill and I was in da club gettin' tipsy! I danced with all kinds of nice gays, shared a drink or two, and even made some new friends! They had go-go dancers which were easy on the eyes. My friends and I sat outside for a bit and were waited on by a very friendly server. There was even a cute twink that would come around with jello shots..the music videos were a nice touch.

There is certainly some diva spiciness in the air here. But at the same time, it's friendly and fun. The crowd is consists solely of sexed up, well-groomed 20 somethings. And that one older skinny guy with platinum hair and the Bono earring. 

BS is really only busy on Wednesdays when they have their 2-for-1 drink special all night. Then, it's packed. Wall to wall. Unfortunately, the drinks aren't so great. You really have to know the bartenders for them to make you a good one, with so many free drinks flying around (and people not tipping when they get them,) they slack. You might be better off opting for beer. 

For us smokers, the proximity of the patio to the bar and dancefloor is nice. In other words, you don't have to isolate yourself to have a smoke. It's all one big churning pot of hair product and muscle, baby. This the place to people watch; ridiculousness abounds without fail. But the best thing about this place is undeniably its dancefloor. There are giant video screens in sync with what's playing (and no ADD DJ mixes). One of the best gay bars in Phoenix to dance at for sure. Nothing tired and stereotypical, just good booty music.

Thursdays and Sundays can also be fun if you're into karaoke. Saturdays are a nice alternative if you don't really dig Forbidden or Amsterdam, it's a different crowd.

I've only been here on Fridays & Saturdays (I hear Wednesday karaoke is supposed to be fun though) and I've never been disappointed.

I don't know if it's coincidence, but I noticed the past few time I've been here the place seems to be more crowded (the last Saturday I was here they were actually charging a $3 cover, which I normally HATE, but I didn't mind it here), which makes it all the more fun! 

The place itself is kind of divey, but I like the layout. There's a small patio when you first walk in and one that's slightly larger in the back. There's a dance area as well as the required dance area stripper poles (which are always occupied...often times by beautiful people who I'm assuming are paid to ""hang out"" on them...but sometimes by ummm...amateurs).  The DJ usually plays good music and they're always showing the usual gay bar music videos (some are fun/campy...some I can do without).

The staff is super cute but don't expect them to remember who you are or what you ordered. 

Be careful with the eye contact, boys, because this place turns into a real meat market. Guys don't know their boundaries so it's a great place to hook up or show off your hot boyfriend. 

After last night's experience I have a few suggestions for BS- forget the expanded front patio or if they're going to keep it big then invest in port-a-potties, and hire another patio server. At 11:30 I felt claustrophobic and it only got worse from there. Straight, drunk chicks, who think we're remotely interested in what they have to offer, should check out Dos Gringo's next door. It's a gay bar honey, I don't care how nice your chi chi's are. 

It's not that I miss the exclusivity of Old Town's BS West but I miss chatting with friends without people bumping into you, being able to go pee, and wanting to dance. Maybe it was just the wacky 'Heaven & Hell Mardis Gras' themed night (I was confused too) but this has slowly become a common occurrence with this bar and it's rather depressing. The crowd is constantly evolving due to nearby ASU but it's not always a good thing.

I bailed on my friends and ended up in a cab that cost double the normal price from Old Town to my house. Not a good night.

This place gets packed and sometimes, when it gets all hot, sweaty and crowded I get panicky like I need a good slap in the face to calm down. Seriously, don't wear your good shoes. Someone will spill a drink on them right before they step on you.

It's also the only place in Scottsdale where I've played spin the bottle since high school. They have this weird little make-out/VIP room upstairs. Just make sure to pee before you go.

And in reality, a lot of straight people go to gay bars these days - it's 2013 people!

With that said, I've gone here both with my LGBT friends as well as my girlfriend. I've also always gone on Wednesdays, which have great drink specials. BSW is a great place to dance and if it so interest you, to check out the muscle-ridden underwear-only go-go dancers.

Drinks are strong. In fact, the very first time I went here within 15 seconds of getting in the gate... one dude puked on another dudes shoe. Neither seemed to care - something of which if that happened in a straight club, you would have got your ass whooped, then thebouncers would have thrown you over the fence. I turned to my gay friend and said, ""you guys sure are wild party animals.""

On Wednesday you buy a drink and they give you chips to spend on drinks later. Gay bars are known for having strong drinks and this place is no different. Any other place in Scottsdale is going to pour you watered down drinks - I know, because I go there too. So needless to say, you get your money's worth here, I feel, on Wednesday.

Parking is mainly in the parking garage, which is pretty plentiful. But if you go later in the night, that garage may be full. But hey, this is better parking than 80% of Oldtown Scottsdale. So get there early, or better yet, cab it there and cab it home.

The last time I was there with my girlfriend and her friends. It was good fun until the end when someone lifted her purse. The friend got a little crazy and upset and blamed us. It is unfortunate that this happened, but I can't nessisarily blame the bar for this act. I did contact BSW the next day and they were helpful., nan",3.75,Kyle,372,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

2-UqtSJD5DLPj-hnFClhZQ,DoKUOUwAsWrlRY6ehzQV_w,2012-03-18,5.0,"Brasserie t was an experience all in its own. The small cube-like restaurant looks more like a modish boutique than a famous Normand Laprise restaurant but the chic style makes it all the more unique. This was the restaurant I so eagerly awaited; I had watched Anthony Bourdain gorge himself with Martin Picard and Norman Laprise on his show The Layover, and ever since I was hooked and ready to try. My meal was superb, the atmosphere was a bit cramped and loud but the food was excellently prepared. I had an amazing cocktail to start that was garnished with what looked to be a dried and candied flower. There was a heavy taste of ginger and cognac but the deep royal purple drink stunned me with it's lightness on the tongue.

Inevitably with a French restaurant I had to try foie gras which I so adamantly put off because of hesitance of the force feeding but their pan seared foie gras with grilled apples was nothing short of divine. The liver was so fatty there was no gritty taste of iron but instead it touched my tongue rich and melted as my taste buds practically receded in joy. Amazing first experience, I'm afraid I have spoiled myself with such an amazing foie gras. 

For the main, I settled on a St. Patrick's Day special that was seared venison with a butternut squash puree and a sweet braise topped with Guinness (to stick with the Irish holiday). The venison was a deep red, almost purple but still tender and moist. I devoured it, completely practically leaving no signs that it once was on the plate. 

Finally, I settled the night with a nice crème brûlée. To be honest, it's hard to go wrong with crème brûlée especially if you can see the crushed vanilla bean within the custard. 

Overall, I had an amazing experience. Perhaps it was the fact I was in good company, and was with people who were acquaintances of Normand Laprise but the food lived up to the standard I expected. I will not comment on price, I don't know how much the check was but I imagine it was quite expensive. So, if you're in Montreal and you feel like treating yourself to an amazing meal and aren't on a budget, Brasserie t should not disappoint you., nan",4.15,Christine,106,"['French', 'Restaurants']",Brasserie t,"1425 Rue Jeanne-Mance

DMhUSDM3UE2u5KFwtifnFQ,DoKUOUwAsWrlRY6ehzQV_w,2012-08-12,2.0,"Brasserie K. What to say? Let's start with it would have been acceptable at less than 2 thirds the price, maybe half. So you can tell where this is going.

Let's start with the Chef: Charles-Antoine Crête. He represents pretty much all my pet-peeves about my Québecois culture. He's unable to master the language and talks like what as a kid we called ""Farmers"" (Turned out we were wrong as most are better educated than the urban folks) by using the basest Joual vulgarities. There's a difference between the word FOOD and the word MEAL, but this is lost on him. Plus his table etiquette is ridiculously missing from a man who everyone seems to consider a great chef. There's a way to holding a spoon my friends. Then there's his condescending behaviour with even his family and friends when he's on TV shows such as l'Épicerie on Radio-Canada.

The Restaurant: Hip and modern in tight quarters but it works. However when I'm paying over 100$ for an average meal I could easily dish out in my tinny apartment kitchen, I expect to sit on more than 10$ patio chairs from Réno-Dépot. 

The Service: The service was fantastic, can't complain. Our waitress, very beautiful and shapely (but that's just me) could have forgone her fake French accent and since we weren't from the ""In Crowd"" we did get treated to some look-downs.

But I can look over a vulgar chef, stupid patio chairs and snobby service... if the food was mind-blowing, but it ain't, let's get this straight, we are talking very ordinary pub grub here. I love gastro-pub, just not this one.

First off I really wanted those parmesan fondues. This was a flashback to the glorious 80s... I was hoping from something tweaked or upgraded, but no, just ordinary parmesan fondues, basically fresh made cheese sticks you can get at any restaurant these days. Although, the tomato sauce accompaniment was really good.

This was followed by the only awesome part of the meal, the Foie Gras plate. This way to pricy portion of Foie Gras was delicious but let's faces it. Foie Gras is hard to fuck up. Salt, pan sear it and just don't overcook it, that's it. So it hardly requires much know-how.

As the main I ordered the bavette, a gastro-pub staple if you will. This was the weirdest looking bavette I've ever had and tasted like regular sirloin, not the hardier piece of meat it's supposed to be. The pat of homemade butter was horrible and the fries - while really amazing - filled up three quarters of my plate. Fries cost NOTHING to produce; I'm confused as to the price of my plate for this very reason.

The desert, a profiterole another throwback to the 80s was indeed very delicious, worth it and saved this experience from total damnation. 

All in all, the food wasn't horrible; it was good, but seriously overpriced for what I received while sitting on PVC patio furniture. Pricey enough for me to not return. For the same price and for gastro-pub that is supremely better, just head on over to Taverne Square Dominion on Metcalf. They also have one of the best, if not the best bar in town., nan",3.42,David,184,"['French', 'Restaurants']",Brasserie t,"1425 Rue Jeanne-Mance

pedigree aside, this place was disapointing, i live nearby and have been wanting to go for a while but they are always full...

went there a few weeks ago for brunch, was disapointed. we had duck rillette, potato au gratin, bavette de boeuf and some egg special with cauliflower mash... 

maybe i don't like rillette, because i didn't like this one, the only good thing was the briochy toast that came with it. and i liked the pickles. 

the bavette was a bit overcooked, and dry, it got a little tough to cut through, i asked for medium not well done...

and it's quite pricey too, more style than substance here...

While we didn't have a reservation (it never would have occurred to me to make a reservation for Thursday lunch), we were seated promptly. The service was warm and attentive, and we were well taken care of.

The salmon tartare is fantastic, with lots of ingredients to give you that briney, salty, sweet, spicy combo that tickles my tastebuds. Hubs had the steak frites, which were also delicious. I'm still amazed that flank steak used to be such a cheap cut of meat and now is super expensive and popular. 

We started with the cheese croquettes which, while tasty, I'm not sure were worth their $7 price tag (there were only three!). 

The patio area is great for people watching, so I'd highly recommend getting your food outside if the weather agrees.

While I really enjoyed my experience there, I'm not sure I'd make it a regular habit, as lunch for two (with one drink each) cost us $80 after tip. A little bit spendy for a casual lunch., nan",3.9,Kristy,419,"['French', 'Restaurants']",Brasserie t,"1425 Rue Jeanne-Mance

We had a 10:00pm reservation (the earliest slot available on Opentable that summer Saturday) and were eternally grateful when they could seat us at 9:30pm. To our surprise, the restaurant was far from packed, although outdoor seating was mostly taken.

The food was really good. We didn't order any entrees; Instead, we got the charcuteries platter (good to share between two people), which included duck rillettes (divine with caramelized onion), foie gras terrine, cured ham, and pork saucisson. Some of the charcuteries were only ok, but some were amazing too... The foie gras rivaled the pate at NYC's Bar Boulud. Additionally, we ordered two corns on the cob (light, simple, delicious with butter and salt/pepper) and a side of fries (very tasty). Our meal ended up being approx $70 with a glass of beer.

As far as French bistro cuisine goes, Brasserie T definietely succeeded in the charcuterie. However, there are little things about the ambiance and service that threw our experience off.

- First, we were seated at a table with no tabletop candle or overhead light. It was so dim that we couldn't read our menus. We requested a table change and got moved to a window table that had a harsh overhead white light (compared to the soft yellow lighting other tables got). Slightly annoyed but too embarrassed to request another table change, we stayed put. But it elicited grumbles from my boyfriend.
- Second, it took foreeeeeever to flag our server down for the check. It was as if she forgot about us after our orders were put in.

Based on the hype (from the Toque connection and NYT review) and menu prices, I had certain expectation about the restaurant as an overall experience. Brasserie T tried to meet those expectations, but it fell just short. Certainly not bad but certainly not amazing., nan",3.69,Vanessa,106,"['French', 'Restaurants']",Brasserie t,"1425 Rue Jeanne-Mance

Wanting a decent meal for my last supper in la belle province, we made reservations for two.  Although the restaurant looks tiny from the outside, while seated it didn't feel claustrophobic.  I scanned the wine menu and decided on a decent Italian red at $45 which I felt was reasonable.

We decided to skip right to the mains.  This turned out to be a bit of a mistake.  Although the wine came very quickly, it seemed to take an eternity to place our food orders.  When the server finally came by, my mom had to request some bread to balance out the wine. For the record, the other servers seemed to be incredibly attentive; I just think we didn't luck out because ours, although very polite, was elusive.

I had the flank steak served with frites.  It was pretty good though I have had better.  I did not like the flavour of the herb butter that was on top of it.  My mom had the salmon and fennel salad which I sampled and thought was very well prepared.  The salmon was so barely cooked that it could have been sashimi!  Tasty!

XT3Iqi-iD9uUbfdqJLzuVg,DoKUOUwAsWrlRY6ehzQV_w,2012-11-09,4.0,"I was so excited about going to this restaurant: that ultra fancy glassed-in place next to the Place des Arts that passersbies gawk at on the way to the metro station. The restaurant was one of several that participated in the 'Taste MTL' event was organized by Tourisme Montreal. The four of us went there on a Friday night and thanks to our reserveration, we were seated right away - the place was already quite busy despite it being still early for dinner, around 5.30ish. 

Since it was part of the said 'Taste MTL' event, instead of ordering from the à la carte menu, we had two options for each of the three courses on offer. For the entrée, I had a plate of salad with sea snails. I thought to myself, ""Let's try to get out of my comfort zone a bit tonight."" Not that I had any other choice, really, since the other entrée was beef tartare with fries, and uncooked meat gives me nightmares. I made an excellent choice. Those little pudgy sea snails were so delicious I think I could easily eat a plate of them as my main, and perhaps dessert. Yes, they were quite wonderful. In fact, if they could sing, they would win the Grammy.  

I had veal medallions as the main course. They were good - really tasty and tender - but it's not something I would pick again next time. Here's the thing, the veal came on a bed of sauerkraut and the waitress didn't tell us that. She explained that the veal came with cabbage, which was factual, but wasn't 100% accurate. I should've asked her to explain the menu in French, the language she was clearly more comfortable in. It's okay though, two of my friends took over those tangy shreddies and thought they were really good. 

Dessert was Paris brest, which came in a generous portion and was meticulously presented. I don't think it was super special taste wise, but perhaps because it's not my favorite dessert to begin with (I prefer crème brûlée), so I have no legitimate complaints. 

But like they say, a restaurant needs to be able to offer more than just good food, and Brasserie T clearly understands that. The decor and ambiance made me wish I had a cottage just like that by the lake. It is sleek and classy inside, just the way it looks like from the outside, and that classiness does not translate into snob, despite our group being dressed rather casually. The staff were friendly, courteous and respectful. I was also impressed at how attentive and quick they were, without being invasive. In short, I would give them a champagne bucket of stars for service.

We left the place full and happy, which is all one can ask from a restaurant, don't you agree?, nan",3.79,Karina,66,"['French', 'Restaurants']",Brasserie t,"1425 Rue Jeanne-Mance

Found the menu online and decided this was definitely better than any number of nearby restaurants price-wise.  While I could have met the meager limit set by my company, I quickly decided to go beyond for my own enjoyment after perusing the menu once seated.
I had a glass of Reisling with the pan-seared foie gras and then a Valpolicella with flank steak, and everything was truly superb.  The wines were excellent, the foie gras was an excellent decadent treat with a side dab of what I believe was pureed squash to balance out the fatty goodness of dearly departed Donald, and the flank steak had a butter/dill/sage (I think?) topping that really balanced that out nicely as well.
The servers are all very polite and helpful, a decided bonus for the english-speaking Anglophile in French-Quebec.  All told, I walked out of there at about $55, which is really a bargain when you take a look at the price list at comparable places.

It is small so a reservation is a good idea and an absolute must if something is going on at Place des Arts.

They have a small menu but they focus on doing things well.  I ordered the shrimp guedille which is sort of like a lobster roll but with shrimp instead.  I enjoyed it quite a bit and thought that the bun they used was pretty high quality.  The fries were crispy, thick and overall really good.

We were met by the smileless maitre'd. We asked the waiter for some advice, but he mostly read the menu aloud (we could do this ourselves, thank you very much). I ordered a cocktail, and some foreign body was floating in the glass. OK things happen, so I asked the waiter to replace it. At this price range of the restaurant, I'd expect him to smile apologetically and replace it without any fuss. Well, not here at Brasserie-T. He started to argue that this obviously foreign body is part of the green leaf, which was floating in the cocktail. I asked him to replace it anyway.

Then the most hilarious part comes. The waiter took the glass away, and my wife observed him removing this foreign thing with his hand (sic!). Then he brings it back, and ... starts to argue again. Now he says it fell into my cocktail from the tree while he was bringing it. Well, we were indeed sitting under a tree, but I don't really care if it's from a tree, or a bird, or anything else - this junk clearly didn't belong in my cocktail. I asked him to just bring me a new glass. Amazingly, unbelievably he continue to argue. At this point I just got sick and tired of it, and just refused the cocktail.

Again the food was decent, but the overall experience was pretty poor.  There are lots of great restaurants in Montreal. Just look elsewhere.

Also, the staff is great! They are available but not annoying, they know what they're doing and are altogether responsible for how great the place is!

As for the food, the menu offers traditional french bistro dishes but what you get in your plate has that special Normand Laprise/Charles-Antoine Crete twist to it that makes it stand out!

My meal went as following:

Creme montee aux oeufs de Hareng:

The perfect way to start a meal! A light Creme Fraiche perfectly flavored with hareng eggs. Not too salty and refreshing, especially with a bit of lemon juice sprinkled over it.

Gratin de chevre et pomme-de-terre:

What a great dish! Tasty and fresh Goat cheese served on a moisty potato and leek biscuit topped with an homemade raspberry and beets vinegar that I am still trying to reproduce at home. This starter by itself is a reason to comeback!

Saumon a l'aneth:

The Brasserie T!'s superstar! A fresh sous-vides slow cooked salmon of perfect texture! You can tell by the subtle taste that it was marinated overnight in a oil and maple concoction that makes it melt in your mouth. It comes with a crunchy fenil salad that leaves you asking for more.

The portion are great and the prices are a deal for such quality food (around 100$ for 2 with starters, meals and a glass of wine)! Also, don't forget to try one of their  ''cocktail-of-the-hour''!

We had a group of 8, and where placed in the very front window, just near the front door and before the bar. Not a highly desirable location.

Menu: Some very intriguing items on the menu.  Range from pates, fish, and beef.  The chef recommended the special ribeye for 2 or 3. It was pricey at $75, however if split among 3 its reasonable and MUCH more delicious than the basic flank steak on the menu.  The 1 kilo of ribeye, came with some mixed green (salad) two cups of frites, and a very good bernaise.  It was AWESOME! Also, not to be forgotten was the vegetable of the day. Corn on the Cob from Quebec. May be the best corn on the cob I've ever had.

Enjoyed - The Ribeye for Two (or three) and the Corn Especially!  Others at the table had the Steak Frites (Flank Steak) and enjoyed it, just not as much as the Ribeye.  

Other:  On the downside, service was very slow. It took almost 30 minutes to get our cocktails after we ordered them, and a very long time for the final bill.  Also, dang it was HOT in that restaurant. Waiter was very nice, however.

Nutshell:  Very good restaurant. Pricey though. Might suggest a week night and outdoor seating over a busy weekend., nan",3.5,Michael,10,"['French', 'Restaurants']",Brasserie t,"1425 Rue Jeanne-Mance

Was unable to get a reservation online, but was able to secure a spot at the bar by stopping in at lunchtime to ask if there were any openings that evening.  Tip: there were many open tables in the restaurant that evening.  Don't rely on the Open Table saying that they're booked as I believe many people had multiple reservations and then make a game time decision.  I had seen the Anthony Bourdin clip where he tried the mushrooms with soft boiled egg, so I knew that I wanted to start my meal with this.  It was divine.  For my main course I chose to get the salmon tartare.  It was wonderful.  I opted for the salad instead of the fries, but wish that I hadn't.  The mixed greens were in very large pieces that made it difficult to eat with any sort of grace.  The dressing was also a bit bland given the bitter taste of the greens.  The fries that I spied on another diner's plate looked delicious.

It's a little small but they also have a few tables set up outside - perfect for those warm summer days. Well, if we ever get them! 

The service was good, and when asked for a 'birthday drink recommendation,' the waitress suggested one of their 'homemade' creations: the Bourbon lemonade. HELLO! It was served in a pint glass and they weren't cheap on the Bourbon so... no complaints! What I especially like about this location is that it just feels like you can walk in at any time of the day, pick a corner and just chill out without anyone bothering you. Love it. 

I didn't have anything to eat so can't comment on the food. That said, if it's anything like Monkland or St-Sauveur, you've got nothing to worry about.

It's pretty ridiculous to have a restaurant this good open only during late nights, i mean that to me is such a tease. But that's what makes this place extra special. I don't even know where to start on how great this place can be for the human species in Montreal, QC. 

This place seems like a fast food joint you go to when you are not sober and craving some junk food. But I will tell you this place is much much more. Calling Centrale Bregham a ""fast food joint"" does not give the place one molecule of justice. 

First of all their staff is ridiculously nice, everyone I ordered from were very helpful in identifying what I would like and they are all very patient with customers. The price is also very fair compared to other Montreal fast food joints. 

I personally came here sober at least twice and thoroughly enjoyed my burgers and sandwhiches. It really doesn't matter what you choose, I truly believe everything on their menu will taste good and be mouth watering. They use a special type of sauce in all of their heavenly creations and any meal you order will fill you up. I mean the food is absolutely unique and different from any other sandwhich place or burger joint you will walk into. In fact, this is my favorite place in Montreal and this is coming from a pretty classy guy that guys to upscale restaurants periodically. 

Just writing this review makes my taste buds tingle and my mouth wetter than it was before I started writing this review. That's how powerful and tasty their food is. So if you come here, ladies and gentleman, bring extra lower body undergarments because this place has food that will make your body experience something pleasant that you will not forget., nan",3.95,Steve,59,"['Burgers', 'Sandwiches', 'French', 'Restaurants']",Centrale Bergham Sandwicherie,"3467 Saint Laurent Boulevard

The unique creations using various types of marinated chicken, beef and fish topped with cheese, fresh vegetables and mild or spicy sauces are noteworthy. I commented to the order taker and sole counter person that I would have to come back to take in all the choices. I therefore opted for the first thing on the menu ""Le Rouge"". An elongated pita pocket meets roll, stuffed to the gills with Tandoori chicken in a sauce I liken to butter chicken sauce, with orange cheese melted through it, lettuce, tomato and onion. I figure by now you can imagine this thing dripped on the tray liner, but was worth the mess. In a way a dream come true butter chicken in a bun. I'm sold for another try. The second item is ""Le Jaune"", so who knows where this rainbow of food will end. To note all sandwiches are priced with or without a trio (fries and a pop). The meat is Halal and there is plenty of it throughout the menu. No need to mention this place must rock at 2:30am and all that meat (and some grease) is a great absorber of other items consumed on The Main.

Dammm there are fast food places that one would consider on the edge of legendary... this is definitely a surprising visit. My first selection was closed so I felt like a sandwich and this showed up. Reviews looked promising so I dove right in. Decor of the restaurant is nothing glamorous but their food is a surprise. I went with the tandoori chicken sandwich and it came with delicious light crispy fries. The sandwich was light, flavorful and a bloody heaping serving. I've never had something so tasty and surprising for fast food in a while! The chicken had a light tandoori flavour but was delicious! 

I never knew this place existed and Algerian fast food is smokin good! 

They give you an option of two sauces. I had both. One is a tangy creamy mayo mustard. The other is a spicier mayo. Both are delicious compliments and great for dipping your fries.

Everything was just awesome!

Location: it is in the beautiful center of the Montreal downtown core area . Perhaps, it is the reason that they are so superb! 

The interior decor: very elegant / yet trendy fast food joint. I find it really creative and elevated with pictures to accommodate. 

Foodwise: I had the donner sandwich. It was not too dry and not too Bloody /liquidy lolol everything held in the bun. The bread was crunchy and tasted fresh.
The CHICKEN was so frkn DEE-liciously TENDER MMMMM yummmyyyy omggg and the fries !!!!! The fries were exactly how I like them not too mashed on the inside,super crispy and thin with a dash of seasoning.

Service:Ok let me be clear, if you think it's as fast as Mcdonalds please think again !!! They don't specialize in serving their menu fast even though they look like a burger king fast food joint, they're not. Prepare to wait 20minutes. Their sandwiches are probably very well prepared and they need some time to prepare it well. The gentleman at the cash was very sweet and patient even after i was looking at the menu non stop to see which one can be THE BEST I EVER HAD! He recommended me this sandwich with pieces of the chicken's thighs and merguez but I refused ! Not a fan of sausages lol
He said it was the most popular... Hmm dammit maybe I had to try it now ill never know until i come again ;)

It's one of the few spots I'd define a fast food that actually serve GOOD food at very reasonable prices. Their Alto Burger trio usually fills me up pretty well, and this comes from a proficient eater.

Alto is strategically placed close to the McGill campus, the ghetto, the residences and the downtown scene. Yet despite the surroundings, it is never full and you are guaranteed to find a seat even when the Montreal Canadians hockey team is playing. 

The common sense with which Alto is run and their great quality for the prices charged would earn them four stars, yet one can't fail to mention their insanely late opening (and delivery) times and their proverbially fast delivery service.

What's more, delivery is free and I've never encountered a ""minimum amount"" barrier. 

I hotly suggest their burger trios and their milkshakes. Pita dishes are OK if you fancy a quick bite but aren't too hungry. The poutine is a good effort, but the cheese is normal grated brick one rather than the traditional curds, so explore other parts of the menu.

It is the meeting point of the restaurant, the deli and the fast food joint.

First off they have their fish of the month specials that vary month to month. A great selection of fish overall and you won't be disappointed. Prices are fair and the fries/chips are very very good. 

The service is good and they are usually always pacted at this small place in Old port. I would suggest going after their deep fried surprise dessert menu if you still have room, the fact is their fish is such a big serving that in the end you would definitely have to save room for dessert.

I grew up on Fish and Chips in the UK and this is by far the best fish and chips place I've found in 20 years living in North America and I've tried hundreds. Okay it helps that the owners came from England and being the best was their strategy but it's not often people actually achieve it. Brit and Chips has. 

Straight away you notice that it's set up like a proper f&c shop, long order counter, long bar table with stools and an area with grouped table and chairs. The restaurant is spotlessly clean; not even salt spills on the counters. That speaks volumes about their approach to business and food. 

There's a superb selection of fish, each served with a unique batter, designed to enhance the fishes own natural flavor but you can opt out of that if you're insistent. There's pies, pasties and some nice shrimp/scampi salads. 

The fish frying is done to perfection. No greasy, oily residue just piping hot fish and soft crispy batter. The two separate easily and the fish remains firm yet easily flakes - just as it should be. The chip frying is unfortunately more haphazard. Twice the potatoes were golden brown, third time dark brown and fourth so dark and blackened ends that we sent them back. Was really surprised but we were told that other customers had ordered them like that. Well not us!  

The menu also includes traditional chip shop items you just don't find in the USA - scotch eggs, pickled onions and mushy peas. All wonderful in their own strange way and a true taste of Blighty. 

Fish review:
Cod and burgundy batter. So good, so much like a taste of merry old England and a wonderful example to anyone of how fish can be prepared and fried. It had all the right notes to take me mentally back years and if you're trying fish and chips for the first time this is the one for you. 

Haddock with maple syrup batter. By far the stand out for me. I have an adventurous side and this speaks to that. A lot of English and a little of Montreal. If they did exports I'd buy the batter by the pint. It's subtle but beautiful. Adds a slight sweetness which enhances the truly fresh, firm fish. It's a combination that is just heavenly. Loved picking this up when it was so hot that it hurts your fingers but it feels so good in your mouth.

Hake and orange crush. An underrated fish in my opinion which is greatly enhanced by expert prep and a good batter. Brilliantly done, elevated this fish to a new level. 

If you're a fan of f&c or trying it as an alternative to the spring fast food you can't go wrong. My favorite fish and chip shop in North America by miles., nan",3.34,Helen,105,"['Fish & Chips', 'British', 'Restaurants']",Brit & Chips,"433 Rue McGill

Brit & Chips owned by the same group as The Burgundy Lion Pub, has taken over the once coveted Mc Gill Hot Dog, and opened its doors to offer locals a more authentic fish and chips experience.

The menu also features Tandoori popcorn shrimp, a variety of pasties and other British foods including pork pies, and sausage rolls.

A healthy option for those avoiding the deep fried page on the menu is the Seafood salad, which is a healthy portion at a great price.

Where the Burgundy Lion has the pub atmosphere dialed in, Brit & Chips has the food perfectly locked in. For lunch or dinner the food is fresh, tasty, and substantial. It's also great for sharing.

The patio was full so we headed inside.  The server who greeted us seemed cranky. But we grabbed a seat anyway and ordered. By the end, our server had gone from zero to hero. 

It seems we got there just in time (around 6:00 pm) because it filled up and before you know it, there was a long line. Our server's mood brightened and he started making jokes and smiling. He didn't even charge my sister for fries. You see, she had ordered just a serving of the cod (burgundy batter), but then I reminded her that I don't like sharing fries. So she asked him for a side order just before our dishes were served.

I had the haddock (maple syrup batter) and we shared the tandoori popcorn shrimp.

It's a little more expensive at $9.50 (for two pieces, $11.00 if you add chips) than I'm used to paying, but well worth it. The batters were tasty and crispy. I liked the cod better, my sister the haddock - good thing we shared. Both fish were meaty and tender, and with so many choices (salmon, hake and the fish of the day) share with friends and try them all. Except the fries, they're so yummy you'll want your own serving. 

I could dedicate an entire post to their tartar sauce - but I won't. It was delish - creamy, tangy, fresh with a hint of dill. Yum.

My sister and I would both go back, but we'd probably skip the popcorn shrimp and try the mashed peas instead. So Brit., nan",3.66,Sara,286,"['Fish & Chips', 'British', 'Restaurants']",Brit & Chips,"433 Rue McGill

Haddock wase perfectly crispy and fresh tasting and with a little lemon squeezed on it, sooo good. I tried to eat slow to savor it, but I couldn't.  Almost considered ordering another one, but we had fried twix we desert on the way.  That was really really good too.

The beans were decent, and the fries were pretty good. The fish was the great part. Lightly battered, flavorful fish, filling but not leaving you feeling stuffed. If I had just had a larger order of the fish with nothing else, the meal would have been even better.

We decided to go for broke and order the Fried Whatever; they deep fry whatever candy bars they have lying around, and serve it with ice cream ($1.50 extra) for $5.00. It took awhile, but eventually 2 plates of 3 deep fried Reeses cups each, and one with a deep fried Snickers bar, were set down.

Indulgent? Of course, but I've occasionally tried deep-fried candies (they're disgustingly popular at the New York State Fair) and these were actually pretty good. The batter didn't make you feel sick as you were eating it, as I tend to feel when thinking about just what ""deep-fried"" is.

From what I hear its not authentic fish n chips like you would typically find in Britan, I think its more playful and ""jazzed"" up a bit, example: my favorite dish is the salmon in new castle batter. I dont think thats a typical combo in Britain but boy is it good!. It is rather pricey, About 12 dollars a meal, also its pretty heavy and greasy but definitely worth the extra cash and minutes on the treadmill. 

This place is not good for groups larger than 4, and even that is pushing it. The decor is charming, service is good, and I would highly recommend it for a relaxed date. The burgundy lion beer on tap compliments any dish here very well., nan",4.02,Cently,46,"['Fish & Chips', 'British', 'Restaurants']",Brit & Chips,"433 Rue McGill

Eats:
- salmon which was delishious so soft, fresh and greasy. 
- cod the same as the salmon
- scotch egg was good for my first one ever

Likes:
- service was good
- prices good
- fish was big and they give lots of chips
- they serve beer
- the menu has more than just fish and chips
- location

Dislikes:
- you leave smelling like something fried
- seating for two works well. Anything more than two can be tough

Simple perfection, the menu includes many types of fish, pies and Brit items.

While the summer rain fell outside, we opted for the Cod and Chips, and the Tandoori  Shrimp to share.

This was the right amount of food for two....

Cod and Chips...melt in your mouth fish, phenomenal crust, cooked just right.  Chips were not from the freezer....yum!!

Tandoori Shrimp....warm mild flavor, so good!!

The maple syrup battered haddock was pretty good, the maple wasn't too overpowering and the chips were GREAT. The service was also really good...the waiter kept making suggestions to make our bill total lower. I understand that Brit & Chips gets pretty busy and I imagine it would get really crowded as the tables are a bit close to one another. I was also surprised to see that they close at 10 or 11pm on weekends... I would've thought that a place like this would be a haven for those who need to...""recuperate"" ;)

Fries were excellent but the fish left a bit to be desired. My wife and I both had the Haddock.  The fish was good and the batter was good but where the fish meets the batter was a bit slimy.  At first I thought that it was greasy or undercooked but it was not.  I think that the fish was not floured or egg washed before being dipped in the batter.

They do not serve tea or coffee!  I think this is to turn the tables over faster.  Really wanted a tea after dinner.   I had the ""flake and ice cream"" dessert.  TERRIBLE, do not order.  As a Scotsman, I have had this often and what should have been a flake (Cadbury's) crushed over a French vanilla ice cream with a cup of tea was a waxy piece of chocolate stuck into the side some soft ice cream with a glass of water......

I will go back as the selection of pies looked really good.  Would love if they had Scotch Pies on the menu.

Rife were the jokes about Brits and how they would boil toast,  and that the only decent thing you could ever eat in London was Fish & Chips.

Well, thank God some things have changed for the better and some things have stayed the same. London is now one of the foodie capitals of the world but the English tradition of great Fish & Chips, with a few small changes and updates,  continues here. I guess it shows what a total opposite of a scenester/ hipster I am since this was my first visit. I've heard tons about this place the past 2 years and I came in with so-so expectations.
There are several versions of Fish & Chips here, differing either in the type of fish or the type of batter they use. I went with the Sole with Sour Cream and Onion batter. It was great and so was the fact that even though everything is deep-fried in oil, nothing came off as greasy or swimming in pools of oil. It was almost light.
I saw a few other interesting items on the menu which i was too full to try but I intend to come back and at least try their Scotch Egg as well as their Deep-Fried anything dessert. Prices are really decent and the service is friendly as well. 

Bonus: If you love Cadbury Flake chocolates like I do and make a point of buying them in bulk everytime you fly through London Heathrow, they serve Cadbury Flake chocolate bar with ice-cream here as well!, nan",4.53,Bobby,341,"['Fish & Chips', 'British', 'Restaurants']",Brit & Chips,"433 Rue McGill

For the uninitiated, Brit and Chips is exactly what it sounds like - a fish and chips shop. They originally opened up in Old Montreal and have relatively recently opened up a second location in the Cote des Neiges district. They offer a variety of different fish and batter combinations along with other British fare such as scotch eggs, sausage rolls and meat pies. For my first experience, I decided to try one of their more eclectic options - hake in orange crush panure.

Outside of the batter, which was quite amazing might I add, the rest of the dish is very traditional and very well done. The fish is nice and flaky and the batter is thin but very crispy. Add to that some nice fries and a dynamite tartar sauce and you have the makings of a great dish. To add to the experience, they have a variety of different British beers you can enjoy at the same time. 

Unlike most locations of this variety, Brit and Chips also does dessert which I must highlight. They have a deep-fry ""anything"" option which is essentially ""pick your chocolate bar from the options we have and we'll fry it for you"". It comes with or without soft serve ice cream depending in your preference. They had Reese's cups so I couldn't pass this up.

It was exactly as decadent as you can imagine it would be. A perfect end to a very good meal.

With the caveat of having not tried Comptoir 21 yet (in the works....eventually), Brit and Chips is by far the best option in the city for Fish and Chips. If you haven't gone yet, you must certainly do so when you are in the neighborhood.

Ils sont situés dans un de mes coins préférés du Vieux-Montréal à proximité de la dernière rue éclairé au gaz de ville. On m'y accueille chaleureusement dans la langue de Molière. La décoration y est sobre, soigné et propre. 
Le menu est à ma surprise relativement varié pour un restaurant de spécialité. Mais je ne me suis pas déplacé par cette soirée orageuse pour manger un patté à la viande même si il est d'inspiration britannique. Parmi le choix de poisson offert je jette mon dévolue sur le Fish & chips à la morue bleue. J'ai été déçu de se qu'on m'a servi. Avant de continuer je dois ici faire une  parenthèse (oui encore une). Ma mère à force d'acharnement est arrivée à faire des Fish & chips aux dorées vraiment difficile à battre mais pas vraiment de style britannique. Je suis donc très exigeant et rarement satisfait de ce qu'on m'offre au resto dans ce domaine. J'ai aussi fait un voyage en Grande Bretagne et comme vous le savez quand on est pas très riche le Fish & chips est probablement la seule chose que l'on a les moyens de manger régulièrement. Je n'apprécie pas ce mélange de patte à frire croustillante à l'extérieur et mole à l'intérieur se fusionnant avec des traces d'un poisson à chaire mole et grasse. 
Pourquoi 3/5 : Même si je les comparent au Fish & chips que j'ai abondamment mangé aux UK ce qu'on m'offre ici se classe dans la moyenne sans plus. Pour moi c'est beaucoup trop gras. Après quelques bouchés je ne goutais plus rien tant mes papilles étaient saturé de matière adipeuse. Les frites était ma fois correcte, les quantités généreuses et la boîte pour emporter simple et jolie. Mais quand même je ne donnerai pas une étoile de supplémentaire pour une boîte! 

Donc j'y retournerais volontier si je suis dans le coin et qu'un ami veut essayer l'endroit, mais ne ferais jamais un détour spécialement pour goûter à leur cuisine.

This part of town looks as if it recently came into some money, so it has a more posh exterior than the rest of Montreal, and while it lacks that North American Euro anytown look and feel so pervasive in the rest of the city, I kind of like it. It's clean, well maintained, and pretty quiet.

But, enough about that...onto the food! The fish was fried expertly, with a crisp finish and flaky interior. The chips were fat, plump and greased up just so to give off that perfect glisten. I had the poisson du mois, which is not only fun to say, but also fun to eat. This particular mois featured a sole with jerk batter that gave the fish a wee bit of kick.

Girlfriend and I ordered the Cod and chips each, and the orders came promptly.
Firstly, the appearance gave and indication on how the taste was going to be. The fish's batter was overcooked and was very dark. The fries were the same, overcooked, and not uniformly cut. 
Like the author of one of the reviews mentioned, it doesn't appear that they flour and egg wash the fish. The batter was slimy on the inside, and frankly put us off.

For the fish choices, they had cod, haddock, salmon, hake & sole. We shared the haddock which came with nigh perfect crinkle cut fries. The fish was moist, had a thin crispy batter and tasted great once we added the malt vinegar, lemon or tartar sauce. Slightly disappointing was the portion size of the fish. There was one medium sized fillet and two small ones - not like the large sized fillets you get when you order fish n chips in England... but I'm usually of the mindset that taste triumphs all, so it was all good. 

To wash down the food, I got the Burgundy Lion Ale which is the only beer they had on draft. It was a crisp beer that went well with the dish and the best part was you could get half a pint for $3.50. 

Fish+chips+a pint of beer=$24 all in. Now that's an equation that would make me a happy customer any day of the week, especially when the food is tasty like it was at Brit & Chips., nan",3.63,Zaman,660,"['Fish & Chips', 'British', 'Restaurants']",Brit & Chips,"433 Rue McGill

I ordered the Haddock, which was deep-fried in a maple syrup batter. It was deeeeee-licious! I was a little worried that the maple syrup would cause the batter to be too sweet but the truth is that I barely tasted it. In fact, if I didn't specifically know that there was maple syrup in there, I'd never have guessed. NOW: the fish was so very flaky and moist and well, perfect. The batter was plentiful, yet light and crispy. The whole damn concoction was simply amazing and, in my opinion, the ratio of fish to batter (or vice versa) was perfect. Bonus? The homemade tartar sauce had a nice little bite to it as well. Tasty.  

As for the chips - well, this is a huge compliment where I come from: they reminded me of the ones my mum makes at home. Nice and thick, golden and not too fried, and thus, not at all oily or greasy. I'm not an expert but these fries were not cooked in week-old oil. Or maybe they were and they're just really good at hiding it. Who knows? In any case, the lot (fish, chips and all) were served upon newspaper, in a pie plate. I finished off the night with a .99 cone topped with one of my favorites: Flake. Noms.

HADDOCK (maple syrup batter) - Acts like a slightly sweet batter. The maple flavor gets lost a bit in the fried grease.

SOLE (sour cream and onion batter) - WOW. If you have a weakness for sour cream and onion junk food, then GET THIS. You get the flavor immediately on the first bite.

Hake (orange crush batter) - One of the most curious types of batter out of the selection. We opted for the half portion ($6) to try this out which was the right choice over the full portion. The flavor is only mildly sweet won't the most bare flavor of orange soda present.

Shrimp Scampi Salad - The shrimp is flavored with herbs and abundant throughout the salad. The salad itself isn't too special. It's not like you have a decent amount of other options if don't want the chips portion with your fish order. Speaking of the chips, they're decent also with a bit of salt.

Salmon has a tendency to dry out and become dense when overcooked - the fish was perfectly cooked, tender and flakey while remaining a blushing pink in the middle.

I ordered the bulgogi and the kalbi and the bi bim bap was real good there better then I had in a long time.

The place was decorated very well (Korean style), it was packed with many customers, and the service was fast.  I believe this place was only open for three weeks when I went.

I ordered the soon tofu chigae (hot soft tofu stew), haemool pajun (seafood pancake), and daeji bulgogi (spicy pork).  Yes, I ate all three.. i was hungry.  My favorite was the spicy pork and soft tofu stew.  The marinade was just right and spices were perfect.  The seafood pancake was more of an egg omelet and the scallions were a bit big, so it wasn't the typical seafood pancake style, but it was still good regardless.

After my meal, I had a nice conversation with the owner's daughter (who was very cute by the way) and learned more about Montreal and the Korean community.

Around a quarter to 2pm, three patrons still sat at the front counter enjoying their warmth and view of the spring snowfall. I was greeted promptly and chose to eat in as I attempted the challenge of translating the paper menu (half French and half Korean). For this effort I was awarded thin stainless steel chopsticks that also looked to be a challenge in and of themselves. After a friendly server explained a few dishes (some of which I had heard of before and others that were completely new to me). I selected the 'Bulgogi' (strips of marinated beef served with rice and salad) over 'Galbi' (short ribs) or 'Dolsot Bibimbap' (a hot rock bowl version of Bibimbap which is a signature Korean dish). I also observed a combo plate that I decided better for a potential next visit. I passed on a dish that I had tried years before in Seoul called 'Katsu' (corn flake batter style fried chicken). The water they serve without being asking tasted funny so I drank my own tea to keep the bill under $10 before tax and tip. You can opt to sit at several counters, at a table or take your order out which lends to the local University crowd. Two women and gentleman worked diligently in the open kitchen area, which is only shielded by a hanging chalkboard menu. Small bowls of 'Kimchi' (a national dish served with many meals made in this case of carefully marinated Napa cabbage) and marinated bean sprouts are served first (the neutral bean shoots balance the spicy Kimchi). I noted that the servers and cooks taste their own creations which is usually a good sign. I managing the silver chopsticks better than expected piling a little of each taste onto each bite. The meat (beef) tasted a little like it had an ""American chop suey"" flavor which brought back memories of my youth (ironic in a good way I thought as I blended the bean sprouts into the beef). My fingers where getting fatigued I put the Kimchi on the main plate as well and ate the second half of the meal together ending with a few last bites by spoon.

Seoul Chako doesn't count as a Korean restaurant to me by the way.) 

We had a combo of kimbap, dukbokgi, and tigim. Along with that, there was some jaeyook bokgeum. Everything was very delicious.

I do suggest that they give out more side dishes (called banchan in Korean) because offering only two side dishes for one group seems a bit unusual in a Korean restaurant. 

We had a young Korean waiter. He was very polite, announcing the names of the dishes when they were ready to be served and apologizing when a customer sat too close to us. When we wanted to add cheese to the kimbap in one of the combos, he told us of the extra charge that would be added ($0.50).

I arrived at about 5:30 and waited maybe 5 minutes for a table at this tiny spot. The whole time I was there I watched the line fill and empty quickly and repeatedly, they are great at turnover here. 

The room is bright and adorable, the menu is full of delicious meals, all kinds of options, more than you see in most of the other Korean restaurants around town. The food comes out quickly and is clearly freshly made and super tasty - the fried dumplings and dolsot bibimbap were both excellent. Maybe not quite as excellent as Chingu, but cheaper and easier to access if you're downtown and definitely full of fresh ingredients cooked up with love. 

My one suggestion: get rid of the plastic plants that line the half wall between dining room and kitchen, they are just gathering dust and starting to look bad. Also maybe give the bathroom a scrub and a fresh coat of paint before it gets really scary in there. 

The staff here are awesome, fast, friendly, multi-lingual, working hard but never making you feel particularly rushed, smiles for days, just a general good vibe that, as much as the delicious food, has me looking forward to coming back., nan",4.06,Risa,882,"['Korean', 'Restaurants']",Kantapia,"364 Rue Sherbrooke O

I made the very wise decision of coming here post-workout and starving, so we ordered a large portion of what was on the menu. The bibimbap was delicious and quite large. The seafood pancake is one of my favourite dishes at an Korean place, and it is equally as delicious here. I also LOVE the soft-tofu soup- nice and spicy and perfect for those cold winter, snowy days. My boyfriend likes the pork katsu and dumplings, both of which I tasted and also enjoyed.

The prices are also great, especially given that I'm a student. My only complaint is that I wish the little side dishes at the beginning were more extensive. At the Korean places I'm used to, in the San Francisco Bay Area, there are way more little starters than what is offered here. Also, a couple times it took quite a while to get served even though we were there at an odd time of day and there were very few other customers.

Turns out, it's a tiny place that seats 15-20 people. Located downtown on rue Sherbrooke close to McGill metro. The floor to ceiling bay windows, perfect for people watching, ensure plenty of light brightens the dining area. The colorful signage and K-pop(which wasn't blaringly loud), along with the young attentive Korean staff create a nice vibe. The open kitchen is a nice touch. 

Service was stellar. The waitress brought us menus and a carafe of clean cold water after we sat down. A small dish of kimchi and another of sweet potatoes were provided while we were waiting for our food, which came out quickly. I expected prices to be on the high end(being downtown and all) but was pleasantly surprised that $10 was enough for my meal with enough leftover for a tip (check out the photo of the menu).

As to the food, the sweet potato appetizer thingy was really nice, but I found the kimchi a little too salty, I've never had kimchi so salty before, so that was a bit off putting.  My friend had the tofu jjigae which was very nice and I would definitely recommend it to anybody that enjoys tofu.  I had the kimchi bokkeumbap with ham, which while also tasty was a bit too salty thanks to the abundance of kimchi.

Definitely more of a lunch place than a dinner place this as a nice option for anybody that works in the area.  The prices are friendly as are the staff and the food seem fairly authentic for  Korean ""fast food""., nan",3.74,Chris,62,"['Korean', 'Restaurants']",Kantapia,"364 Rue Sherbrooke O

I've been here more times than I can say and normally that is paired with ""spent more money than I'm comfortable telling"" but that isn't the case for Kantapia.

Think not even taped the surface of this menu! Geesh! I think this place taken over my top spot for local style plate lunch food. Plus if local food not your thing they have another whole section of the menu of Chinese. No doubt is coming too Island Style need too go local style!!!!!

I keep hearing about the Meat Jun and its something always always been fan of when it comes too korean food. Toss up between Meat Jun and Kali bi. Only winnahs either or both. The Meat Jun was Amazing!! I love the fact that the egg batter outside not too thick but just right amount of coating not see the meat until dig in, outside nice golden brown, the meat inside has nice seasonings, and meat was moist. Tradition local style white rice and mac salad. I liked the mac salad. The portion size is great! All of it under ten dollars. Is there better deal for lunch?? Think not! Hawaiian food always get your money worth and more....

One of the highlights was the sides that your meal came with at Island Style. Moist Korean restaurants been too can be hit or miss the amount they give plus the different types you get. Here you get five different ones. Although it was only me they were very generous with everything. Korean kim chee fan for life. The kim chee here not hot hot but still good. The roasted peanut action. Now if that doesn't speak too keeping it local style not sure what else can say.  It comes with anything you order almost like bread no charge. They even put it in a to go container so can take it home. Sweet! 

The service was great! U can tell local owners and care about putting out good local grinds. They just expanded couple weeks ago so restaurant is lot bigger. I went for lunch so the place was not too packed. Parking can be issue if go when busy since only parking in front of the restaurant. If looking for Meat Jiun Island Style the only way too go. No doubt plan on going back because Kali bi, Katsu, combo plates, fried noodles, and so much more too try., nan",4.14,Chad,418,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Didn't exactly find either, but married an L.A. girl, raised a family, had a decent career and am now enjoying life.  We vacation in Hawaii about every other year still, and as I'm an honorary Angeleno, my wife is an honorary Local.  So we like Hawaiian culture and lifestyle.

We visit Las Vegas at least once a year, and thanks to yelp, we found Island Style and made our first visit last week.  The yelpers were right on!  We liked the food and the Aloha Spirit epitomized by Russell and the young waiter who served us.  Besides tasting good, the food is comfort food for us.

We LOVED the boiled peanuts that came before our food.  As we explained to Russell, every time we return to Honolulu we immediately go to Times Market to buy a tray of boiled peanuts to nibble with our beers on the lanai.  Taste just like when I was a kid sitting in Honolulu Stadium watching the Islanders (yes, I'm old).  The good old days!

I won't go into a food review because other yelpers have done that. I'll just say that if you like Hawaiian-Asian food, da kine you would like to eat at home, dis is the place to find dat when you stay Vegas.

Regardless of what type of food it was, it was super tasty!

I ordered the teriyaki beef plate.  It came with rice and macaroni salad.  The beef and the macaroni had great flavor.  The rice was rice, and tasted like rice should.  The curveball was that they served Korean style vegetable side dishes, like kimchi, to go along with the food.  They were okay, but the real highlight was the main entrée.  I am still salivating over how delicious the beef was, and I can't wait to have it again.

I first came here in 1994, when I was a wee student homesick for some local kine grinds.  There was no L & L those days, so we'd have to make the trek all the way up Sahara to get here.  Short story long, no matter strong my craving, it was tough to get here and it was lost to memory.

Fast forward to 2010 and, thanks to Yelp and Misti Y, this place is back on my radar.  It's still a haul from my hood, but I HAD to give it a try.  Walking in the door was, well, strange.  It looked and felt completely different.  Gone was the darkness (not sure if they even turned on the lights back in the day), the drink cooler up front and the booths.  Apparently, three renovations makes a difference.

Anyway, enough with the memories and down to business: the food.  There were four adults and two kids in our party, so we took the big table up close to the counter.  We were readily greeted with boiled peanuts and juices for the kids (it was pretty amazing to watch how an entire can of juice can make kids bounce of walls).  We were also brought never-ending dishes of different types of kim chee, which always seemed to be empty when I looked for it.  The mandoo was especially tasty, definitely not the kind you get from the market.  Our meals were onolicious and no one left hungry or a plate empty.  

I like this place, but it's so far out of my normal eating radius.  I hope to be back before another 16 years elapses., nan",3.73,Patrick,168,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

I didn't have the pleasure of meeting the Wife but the husband (Russell) was a great host. He even compt our drinks. And their son, cute Asian kid, was so pleasant and very attentive.

We were completely blown away by the generosity and kindness of our server. He was friendly and chatty with us, but not overly intrusive. Felt like we were old friends.

Rusty sold me and my crew from the first minute on the family style dining, we immediately felt as if we were family, to the point that I and my my friend told him to bring is what he liked . Best decision! 

The food was amazing. Come with empty stomach and come at closing. He unloads the kitchen onto our table. My chopsticks nearly caught on fire; they never stopped moving for a solid 45 min.

I live in LA and they have a ton of Hawaiian restaurants but this one stands out by FAR! What makes this place so great is not only the food, but the GREAT, TERRIFIC, AWESOME hospitality. The owner here just makes you feel like you're family and right at home.

1. Loco Moco (hamburger and egg on top of a bed of rice with gravy)
2. Fried Rice Omlet
3. Bim Bim Bop 
4. Fried Saimen
5. Chicken Katsu
6. Fried Mandu (homemade, the owner was so nice to let us try this on the house) 

Everything was delicious! I mean the Katsu was crunchy, the fried saimen contained the freshest ingredients (spam, cabbage, kamaboko, saimen noodles, eggs, etc), the bim bim bop had great flavor, the loco moco had some pretty awesome tasting gravy which made the dish so good, and the fried rice was great (something so simple tasting so good just tells you how good it is).  I don't know exactly what was in the fried mandu but man did that taste good as well. I don't even know what more to say except that I would highly recommend trying this place out.

NEGATIVE stars only. He was RUDE, BAD ATTITUDE and has
NO COMMON COURTESY.  We called at 545pm to make sure 
he was open (since he closes early if  business is slow ; even
when hours are POSTED 10AM-9PM); he said they were open
so told him we would be there at 7PM; he said ""sure sure, how
many people ""; told him 7adults on child. He said  OK. When
we arrived at 702P, the door was locked, CLOSED sign in the
window. We could not believe he was closed since we had
called, We knocked on the door several times and even called
twice but NO ANSWER. We peeked in the window and it was
dark ( LIGHTS OFF, NO BODY there). I thought Russell was
kidding/being playful but after waiting ten minutes we left .
It was quite embarrassing to our guests (they could not believe
this was happening). Needless to say, we went to a ""reliable
restaurant"". A favorite that always has excellent food and
provides excellent service consistently ( they  know how to 
treat us/customers and always welcome our business). 

The next day,  I called Russell and told him we were 
disappointed he was CLOSED when I had called before
going there. He was rude and abruptly barked at me 
""No can help...No Cook...I no can cook so I had to close""; 
 ""Cook had to leave because her baby sick (emergency?)"".
old him, ""We did not  know his cook had to leave; how were
we to know?"" Told him, ""You should have waited to tell us.""
He said ""couldn't, I had to drive her...she no drive"". I said ,
 ""we don't know that...all we saw was the CLOSE sign...
you could/should have left us a note!"". He did not feel bad 
or apologize. Instead he   RUDELY said "" SISTA, YOU ONLY
MAKING ME MAD"".   I said ""WHAT, I'm making you mad 
(I was angry and  insulted) .""   Said, ""That is no way to run
a business!!!""  He said,  what!!!. you wanted me to call Gina?
 She no can come,  she get her own restaurant to run"".  
Told him,  ""Fine, you' won't see us anymore"" (and hung up).

It's too bad he  does not think he was wrong  for his
BAD/POOR  service. (He does not believe in CUSTOMERS
Always Right; and Customers can help to make a business
grow.)  

We have/had frequented  this place; brought and introduced
several friends and relatives to Island Style; But, NO MORE!!
We are telling them  we will  NO LONGER patronize this
'hole in the wall' place and they will follow us.  He will lose
our business and theirs. He should have been considerate
his customers (NO common sense). Definitely needs  to
improve on his ATTITUDE, BEHAVIOR and COMMON

Island Style is a very unassuming place in the middle of a nondescript strip mall on the west side. As plain looking as the place is, it is really about the food. I had hot rock Bil Bum Bop and the Missus had a combo that included the best tasting Kalbi ever. The homemade Kim Chee (cabbage, Radish, and cucumber versions) was terrific. Everything on the menu is hand made. As we were walking out, they were making fat hand stuffed won tons.

The only down side was that we ended up eating everything to the point that we may have to beg off on our dinner reservation at the big time strip restaurant.

Affixed upon the wall are some articles about Island Style. The original gentleman who cooked Hawaiian food for Island Style, as I found out from Russell, passed away in 2002. Russell is half Japanese and half English/Irish and his wife, Gina, is Korean. She worked with the original cook, and when that gentleman passed away, she continued on with his beloved cuisine and also decided to include Korean offerings. Russell said that there was a period of time where she was just using the cheapest canned ingredients from Sam's Club or Costco, but since he entered the business, they have been making everything fresh. 

We were sitting amongst some elderly and another family and everyone seemed very laid back while enjoying their seemingly scrumptious morsels and bites.

He appetized our palates with

Boiled Peanuts: a complimentary and delicious appetizer of whole peanuts still in their shells that have been boiled in a soy-based brine with a very unique blended texture of hard and soft.

Spicy Cucumber: a complimentary, crisp, and slightly tangy side dish

Radish and Kimchee: I didn't care much for the radish, and the kimchee was still refrigerator temperature cold, but it was delicious

We ordered the

Hot Rock Pot Bi Bim Bop (Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop): Delicious rice, perfectly runny egg, thin strips of nori, and a blend of vegetables in this super hot rock pot will make your mouth water before, during, and after! The rice touching the rock pot is crispy and just the way I like it, like a crust made from rice. 

Combo (Kalbi, Chicken, Jun): standardly marinated and grilled meats, mostly tender and came over white rice

We arrived for dinner, as a huge group of 25+ people were leaving the restaurant. Service was dismally slow, as my friend and I sat there staring at the counter waiting for someone to take our orders. When they finally brought us a glass of water each, as well as the side dishes, the water was the most disgusting water I have ever tasted; either someone did not wash the glasses right, or the pipes in the establishment are filthy, because the water tasted like buttermilk. 

When the waiters got around to acknowledging us, the service was otherwise pleasant and attentive, and our waitress was very helpful in explaining the dishes. Food was otherwise quite tasty, I ordered a bibim kook soo that was everything I would expect from a Korean restaurant like this. 

At the end of the meal however, as I was eating some kimchi, I found an odd-looking vegetable in there, and lo and behold, there's a pickled flying insect inside of a leaf!

Especially when I see meat jun on the menu.

One ""Aloha Friday,"" two of my friends and I were off and since we were in the area, we came here as they just opened. 
After reading all the reviews on this place, I expected it to be a ""hole in the wall"" but, it was quite spacious with 10+ tables. I could see how it would be small when it gets busy but, it's not as small as a ""Hawaii hole in the wall"" would be. 

Anyways, when we first entered at 11:15 (15 mins after opening, there was already a couple people waiting on their orders. 
The gentleman that greeted us (I assume, the owner) told us to sit where ever we wanted and had so much energy that he basically told us the favorites within 5 minutes of sitting down.

I already knew I was going to order the meat jun. 
Since another friend couldn't decide on what to order, she just ordered the combo. 
And my roommate ordered, fish jun AND luncheon meat with eggs.

- Meat jun was good that the meat and egg batter was sweet. Slices of meat was thin but, thick enough that it didn't fall apart from the egg. 
The meat jun sauce wasn't to my liking tho as it isn't as vingegary as Jun's meat jun sauce but, the meat jun itself was good enough that I could eat it without sauce.
******If I could eat Island Style's meat jun with Jun's sauce then life would be perfect.
- The combo was good that the chicken and kalbi had a good marinade as it was sweet.
- Fish jun was good for my friend but, not my cup of tea. He loved his luncheon meat meal out of the two as he hadn't had luncheon meat since being a kid in Hawaii.

The banchan (Korean side dishes) is better than most places as they had boiled peanuts. Can I just tell you that I haven't had peanuts in FOR-EV-ER!
Kim chee radishes and bean sprouts were yummmmy, too! Not to much spicy and wayyyy crunchy :)

Oddly enough, the best thing about the whole meal was the hot tea. We had 3 cupfuls of hot tea before we left. The owner even took the bag of tea root out to show us and told us how to prepare it. 

I was so full after this meal that I didn't eat til 9pm the next night. And I still have leftovers!, nan",4.14,Laurie,427,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Well, I give all the credit to Island Style for giving me the best late lunch in a very long time. 

I was on an eating restriction day (vegetarian) and needed something to eat. As I was leaving the Greenland Supermarket, I was desperate for a meal since I bought all the supplies for a Korean feast.

I asked the guy at the counter if there was anything vegetarian. He went through the menu and explained everything to me. I settled on the Bibimbap, which was rice with fantastic vegetables, and a fried egg on top. Filled my (korean in a past life) belly. It came with a miso type soup and a side of pickled sprouts. All for about 8 bucks. A great deal!

What really made me happy, was the guy at the counter, even gave me instructions on how to eat it with all the sauces and such. Very nice.

Took off one star, because there was nothing from the sea, and I was open to seafood that day., nan",4.06,Dave,432,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

The bare-bones dining room was also a bit surprising to me, but the food is solid.

COMBO PLATE: This three-meat treat will set you back about $16 but is easily enough food for two. The kalbi was my favorite, while BF preferred the meat jun. Sides of mac salad and rice are plentiful, and you also get the banchan (mostly spicy/pickled items this visit).
MANDU: Pot stickers, available in half (4 piece) and full (8 piece) orders, either pan-fried, deep-fried, or steamed. The fried versions were soggy but the dipping sauce is tasty.
SPAM MUSUBI: I love this dish, but not here. Entirely too much rice, and such minimal sauce as to render it nonexistent. It's sad when L&L makes a better version.

Service was attentive and pleasant. Menu has a lot of options, but you can easily get a filling meal under $10/pp here.

Imagine a fusion of Polynesian-spam-based lunchroom, Korean kim chee joint and basic Chinese restaurant. Usually, when we hear ""Korean,"" it's some sort of Asian BBQ joint. Not this place.
Upon sitting down, you will get a number of different pickle-type appetizers. We got two types of kim chee, kelp noodle in a mayonnaise sauce that was quite new and tasty, boiled peanuts, and bean sprouts in brine.
We ordered the pan-fried dim sum and it was adequate.
We ordered the fried chili shrimp and the meat-and-seafood stir fry. 
The waiter warned us that the stir fry was the real deal, with sea cucumbers (sort of a cross between mushrooms and squid, but slimy). And indeed it had sea cucumbers, but nice enoki mushrooms too. I'm honestly not a huge fan of sea cucumbers but as the wait dude promised, they help make a nice gravy.
Both dishes had a mix of fresh vegetables and that staple of Polynesian/Chinese lunchrooms, mixed frozen vegetables of cut string beans, corn, cubed carrot and peas. I put that mix in canned chicken noodle soup to increase the nutrition content, but otherwise don't see much advantage to adding frozen mixed vegetables to real food.

It was quite a drive for me, especially when my usual Hawaiian BBQ of choice is so much closer. But, I'd drive the distance to try a new place or to have some exceptional food, without a doubt!

There was a party of 4 and another party of 2 dining and a gentleman behind the counter/register, nobody else. Must of been the off peak hours.. Shortly after I entered the shop, I had a seat and the man greeted me with that typical island swag (real mellow and inviting). We had some small talk and I found out he was the owner. I told him that I really love Hawaiian food and that I drove across town, passed several other places alike, just to have a try. He became interestingly ecstatic and started suggesting what to order. Mann, the way he was talking about his wife's cooking (she's the chef/cook), I was convinced that he'd lead me the right direction! (he even showed me visuals too, actual photos of their food)

Starters that I did not ask for! All on the house!

Hot Tea: with the cool weather nowadays, this helped

Boiled Peanuts: just as the name says, simple pre-game snack 

Napa cabbage & Radish, both prepared korean style: I liked munchin' on these. They're actually Outstanding!

Fried Mandu: 5 pieces of fried mini empanada looking things and dipping sauce. Pretty Good 

Actual order:

Combo (Kalbi, Meat Jun & BBQ Chicken): nicely portioned for one hungry person. The included Macaroni salad was creamy, mildly flavored and a bit softer in texture than I'm used to. Kalbi was real tasty, cooked right (just enough, not over done) and ripped right off the bones. BBQ Chicken was better than any I've had (in regards to hawaiian bbq chicken)! And I purposely saved the Best for last, the Meat Jun! Its a thin cut of ribeye steak dipped in egg! The steak had a mild balanced sweet/salty flavor and was so tender (like ribeye should be) but I'm talking about as soft as the egg! I'm thinking that the butcher must of pounded the living @#$% out of it cause I could of sliced that thing with the handle of my knife! Not only that, it seemed the egg had a hint of some sorta cake/vanilla flavor in it that totally caught me off guard. Combine that with the steak and this soy based looking dipping sauce....I was SPEECHLESS! I Almost shed a tear, a tear of happiness of course! Do NOT Pass This Up!

Side of Gravy: just wanted to try it and I'm glad I did! Not as thick as I've had at other places and more dark brown in appearance.. Great, just like everything else!

After the meal, the owner brought me a little bowl (sample) of the their Saimin soup. Piping hot, a tad salty and Soooooothing!

Hawaiian BBQ & Korean Fusion at its Finest!!! Food was Very Impressive and absolutely made with True Passion, Love and Evident Skills!!

The owner remembered me and had that same pleasing and chill attitude! Brought over the boiled peanuts quickly and took my order promptly as well:

Fish Jun: Alaska Pollock Fish Fillet dipped/wrapped in egg! I loved the Meat Jun so I wanted to try the fish version this time. Well, it was the same difference!! So Mother Freakin' Good!! Soo ""ONO"" as the islanders would say! Once its dipped in their sauce, its a done deal. I had to ask what was the origin of the ""----- Jun"".... The Owner told me that it was Koreans in Hawaii that started making this back in the day.. Gamsahabnida! (Thank you!) Koreans from Hawaii! 

I was also brought the napa cabbage, radish and sprouts (korean sides). On top of that, a small bowl of hot Saimin soup to cleanse the palate. Nice!

We exited the 15 and headed out to the location. When we arrived we asked could this really be the location? The location is in a tiny strip mall. We decided to walk in. What a surprise, the place was really clean and we were greated by a welcoming man by the name of Russell. 

We ordered the spicy pork and the combo plate. All of the food was awesome I couldn't choose a favorite. The tea was some of the best tea I have had, Russell was nice enough to show me the bag so I could get some later. 

This is some of the best food my wife and I have had. We will always stop here when in Vegas or close by. We even joked that we may have to move to Las Vegas just to be able to eat here.

I've read many great reviews about this place so I wanted to make my belly happy as well.  I ended getting the seafood Soondubu and the brother had a combination plate. 

When we sat down the server brought out ice cold water and Banchan (small dishes of food served in Korean cuisine).  Let me tell you, the Banchan were not small.  I personally killed the kimchee radishes myself.  Sorry brother.

The Soondubu (spicy tofu soup) came out boiling hot (burn-my-tongue hot).  First time having this so I was quite too excited.  It came with mussels, clams, shrimps, and a side of flavorful fried fish with a small bowl of rice.  I expected the soup to be a little more spicy but it was not spicy at all (for my taste).

Brother enjoyed his plate but was wanting more rice.  I had a bite and the meat was tender and juicy.

The food was just awesome! Since Hawaiian influence on the Korean food tends to make it sweeter, I suggest that you order a combination of spicy and regular dishes. Ask the owner for suggestions. I loved the combo plate. And, the price is the best deal in Vegas.

Island Style aka Baek-il-an is a Hawaiian/Korean/Chinese restaurant that surprisingly gets all three cuisines right. I tried the Loco Moco from the Hawaiian menu and it was fantastic. I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with any mac-and-cheese but the ample amount of ban-chan will keep you preoccupied.

If you like spicy noodles, I highly recommend the Bibim-Guksu. Simply the best guksu I've had in Vegas and possibly top K-town California guksu. My friend calls it 'the crackdish'. Yes, you will be addicted to it as well if you're a fan of bibim-guksu.

If bibim-guksu doesn't excite you but you still want noodles, maybe you can try the black bean noodles or jajjangmyun. If you're REALLY indecisive the jjamjamyun is a great choice; one portion of jajjangmyun and another portion of jjam-bong (spicy seafood with noodles) on a single divided bowl.

I'll have to say all the dishes I've had at Island Style/Baek-il-an has been satisfying. It seems a little awkward to have one restaurant host such a variety of different food but if they get it right, who's complaining??!?!!, nan",3.99,Ben,98,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

As we drove up, went in and sat down, there is nothing special about the ambiance of this place.  The place did not feel welcoming.  Bland, basic decor, lighting is almost hospital sterile in many ways.  Based on the name, we thought it would be 75% Hawaiian food and 25% Asian Fusion food.  But in reality it was 30% Hawaiian food and 70% Korean food.

We focused on the Hawaiian dishes and we just thought they were OK.  We tried Bi Bim Bopp, Masubi and the Combo Dish (meat & egg platter or sorts).

Better still, only one item on the menu is over $10 and you are generously showered with large portions of free appetizers.

We were given addictive boiled peanuts and kimchee, as well as pickled bean sprouts, cucumbers, and radishes, all before we even ordered. The peanuts were the highlight, with the shells enveloping the salty brine they were cooked in so you could enjoy it with your legume. Did I mention they were free?

As you may have surmised from the appetizers, Island Style serves ""Fusion Korean Food and Island Style Loco Food."" Though you may recognize most menu items, many will probably provide you with a learning experience, as they did for me. Don't worry, your uber friendly host will explain each item with big picture menus and photos on the wall so you aren't at a loss for what to order.

I passed on my favorite Korean dish, Bi Bim Bap, in favor of the Hot Spicy Beef soup ($9.90). This was served in a massive bowl filled to the brim with shredded beef, glass noodles, mushrooms, scallions, and egg simmered in a paprika broth (think Korean goulash). It was hot and spicy for sure, but not overwhelmingly so, and it kept growing on me sip after sip. Ian ordered the Meat Jun ($8.25), which we both agreed was even better. This dish consists of pounded beef marinated in a sweet and salty shoyu (soy) sauce, that is then coated in egg and pan fried (think paillard francese). It is served with rice, bland macaroni salad (a Hawaiian staple), and more of the incredible shoyu sauce. If you eat meat, get this.

We were honestly shocked by how good the food was as it was better than anything we had in Hawaii and there were actually some healthy items as well. The server, who I believe was the owner, couldn't have been more genuine, friendly, and competent. Even if the food wasn't good, we still might have gone back anyway just because of his hospitality.

Only a person from Hawaii that eats Korean food knows what meat jun is.  Even Koreans from Korea are confused when I ask if they have meat jun on their menu!  Seriously!  I don't know if this is a hybrid of Korean food, a fusion of some sort, or just a dish created by a Korean that lived in Hawaii.  Besides Island Style, the only other place I can get meat jun is back home.  Luckily, the owners of Island Style are from Hawaii so they are in the know!  Doesn't hurt that this place is also less than 10 minutes away from my work.  

Super busy place, so if you come for lunch especially be aware that parking in this little strip mall will be TIGHT.  You may have to park across the street or in the strip mall next door.

Even with the hustle & bustle the service is pretty spot on.  After being seated the treats start.  Usually, if you're lucky you will get a basket of boiled peanuts.  I love boiled peanuts!  Brings me back to when my Dad used to buy bags of the stuff to bring home for an after school snack.  These folks are definitely from Hawaii.  Nice.

Majority of Island Style's entrees come with a plethora of banchan.  In Korea, these are various side dishes that go with the meal.  We were in high supply that day, I think we were given a mix of 7-8 different banchan to enjoy.  Geez, I can't remember them all but we did have kim chee for sure.  It was real good, spicy, tangy, sweet...I even requested a second helping to go with my meat jun.  Wonder if they make it in house or if it's store bought?  Couldn't tell (and I eat my fair share of kim chee) but it was certainly tasty.

On to the main, my meat jun.  What can I say?  It was worth the time and effort!  Island Style serves some KILLER meat jun.  It tastes the way like I enjoy whenever I'm back home on Maui.  Marinated bulgogi beef, lightly battered in egg, then pan fried to GBD perfection.  GBD?  Golden, brown, delicious, DUH!  Island Style cooked mine just right.  Not too heavy, not too oily, but full of delicate flavors.  Hints of sweet, savory, and texture from the egg?  Perfection.  Accompanied by the meat jun dipping sauce, a bed of hot white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad (yep, Hawaiian), and a side of kim chee?  Very good down-home eats.  No pretentions, nothing fancy.  A good meal.  The only thing that could have made it better was if there was an additional piece of meat jun on my plate.

Entree wasn't too heavy on the pocket either, coming in at around $9 including all the banchan that was afforded to me.  Very good value.  In fact, most of the entrees on the menu come in around the $7-$9 mark depending on what you order.  And the choices are numerous.  I'm sure most of it is highly recommendable, but for now I'll be sticking to the meat jun.  My homey Korean-Hawaiian friend.  So take me back, back to da kine!, nan",3.67,Chris,330,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

I was feelin' the Korean vibe that day so I went with a staple, the Bi Bim Bop.  Rice topped with bulgogi beef with lots of veggie sides like pickled carrots & daikon, bean sprouts, spinach, and cucumber, all topped off with a runny sunny side up egg, sesame seeds & seaweed!  Comes with a side of broth too for pouring over.  Delicious!  Love that runny egg yolk combining with the hot rice & bulgogi, then getting the crunch from the cool veggies.  That's some good eats!  I should have opted for a dollar or 2 more for the Bi Bim Bop in the hot stone pot, would have been sizzling hot from beginning to end.

Island Style has the hookup for banchan too!  Who else in town served boiled peanuts as banchan?  Such a good start to a meal.  I had no shortage of other banchan either - kim chee, kim chee cucumbers, bean sprouts & more.  Sides to my hearts content!

I also got a Cheeseburger as well.  Surprisingly simple & tasty!  Flat top grilled meat, cheddar cheese, fresh lettuce & tomato, bun.  And lots of mayo & ketchup just the way I like it!  Opted for no fries, needed to keep the calorie count down LOL.

Island Style I'll be back again when I need me some down home eats!

I mean, talk about an owner taking pride in his business and giving his best. This is a total hole in the wall joint, but don't be fooled by its location or outside appearance. This is Korean Hawaiian fusion at its best!

As soon as we sat down, we were given menus and boiled peanuts to munch on while looking over the menu. Already, we're off to a good start! There is so much to choose from, so just go with what you're in the mood for.

What we ordered:

Musubi: SPAM on top of rice, all wrapped in nori. There is a special sauce in there, quite possibly with a little bit of crack in it. Crack sauce. I love it.

Yook gae jang: there is really nothing better that cures a hang-over than hot, spicy soup. This had all the right ingredients and the perfect amount of spice. I hate that some places skimp on the meat, or have wayyyy too much green onion, or whatever the case may be. But our soup had the right amount of each ingredient, which gets an A+ in my book.

Jjam Jja Myun (Jjajang myun and Jjambbong in a split dish): The best of both worlds! I love both noodle dishes, but hate wasting the food because we usually can't finish it all. But this way, you get half a serving of the Jjajang myun, and then half a serving of the Jjambbong.

Loco Moco: this heart attack waiting to happen is rice, hamburg steak, a fried egg, and then gravy poured all over the top. It's very heavy, very savory, but incredibly delicious! We opted to get our gravy on the side, so that we can limit how much gravy to pour over. I think it worked out for the best, so as not to overwhelm our taste buds with too much heaviness.

Backtrack, I want to give some more kudos to the owner's son. He doesn't even need to say anything, just one look at him and you know that he is a kind and gentle soul who really just wants to provide excellent service to go along with the even more excellent meal. He noticed one of the girls in our group was very sick (she completely lost her voice, we later find out she had pneumonia!), so he brought some hot tea, lemon and honey...without her even asking. I just think that's the kind of service that's hard to find these days -- where they offer to bring or give something without you asking for it first. I really felt like he cared about our experience in his restaurant, whether just the overall experience or the quality and taste of the food. Thanks for one of the best meals we had in Vegas!, nan",4.19,Tina,410,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

They had a range of dishes from loco moco to bibimbap.  We ordered the cold Korean noodle and their mixed BBQ platter which consists of the short ribs, meat jun and chicken breast.  You can tell they take pride in their BBQ as each piece was grilled to perfection.  I really enjoyed the meat jun (Seasoned ribeye dipped in egg before pan frying) especially with their dipping sauce.  The banchan (free refill) that came before the meal was also delicious, well seasoned bean sprouts, kim chee and radish. The owner/server was very nice to us and even gave my wife an extra cup of their specialty Korean tea to go.  We also had some fresh peanuts that just finished boiling in Hawaiian sea salt.  All this for $20, not a bad deal at all.  We will definitely be coming back to try out more of their menu items.

They did give banchan, which was interesting. They had Vienna sausage as one, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about that. It felt kind of cheap. 

We ended up just getting a spamusubi and shared chicken katsu. The spamusubi could have used more sauce, there was very little and it just felt like eating spam and rice. My friend ended up just dipping it in the sauce of the banchan. The seaweed seemed like it was harder to eat than the ones I usually get at other places. The chicken katsu was okay, nothing amazing.

On the plus side, the service was really nice. They made sure we had what we needed, but it started to feel too attentive. Everyone in the restaurant left and my friend and I were the only ones in there with the employees. They all started to stare and if started to feel like they were trying to close or something.

1.  Hungry - They will serve huge plates with tons of food. It is a great deal and tasty too.

2.  For me - I love Hawaiian food and also cook it at home. Here at Island Style, the mix of great Hawaiian food and excellent Korean food is the best combo.

3.  Vege anyone? If you are not a huge meat fan, try their Bi Bim Bop, which is vegetables over rice. With the chili paste called go chu jang (not very hot) mixed it, the taste is well, freakin awesome!

4.  Service - For a small place, really great and friendly.

5.  I live kind of far from here, but I am trekking back here with the entire family. They will love this place.

I did line the boiled peanuts and the banchan. I got my favorite soondobu and it is about 50% larger than a regular place so it was just right.

We walked in and the place was busy seemed like the end of lunch rush. The tables are stacked next to each other in the middle like family style or large groups. So you would end up sitting next to strangers. That I didn't like at all. It was bad enough that as soon as we walked in all eyes were on us. I hate that. But we found a table by the wall where we could sit alone. The tables that were empty were dirty. Our server Jody (male) he was nice and cleaned off our table while we sat down. 

Jody was what made me give 4 stars instead of 3. He was so nice and so personable, not to mention very attentive. Good service makes all the difference to me. 

Looking at the menu I was quite overwhelmed. It's huge! Perhaps because it's in both English and Korean. But I didn't know what to order so my friend said she always gets the combo plate. We both ordered the combos. Then some lady comes by puts little kimchi dishes on our table and boiled peanuts. The boiled peanuts are interesting but pretty good. I now know I am not a fan of kimchi. I didn't like it. I tried a few. The bean sprout one and the radish one and some sort of white noodle thing. 

The combo comes with teriyaki BBQ chicken, beef rib tips, some meat egg combination I think it was called Jin, lots of rice, macaroni salad and a dipping sauce. It was good.

BOILED PEANUTS: Get in on it. Enough said. 

FOOD: The menu offers a big variety of classic Korean dishes such as Soon Dubu, Naengmyeon, GalbiTang, and Kalbi. All of which I have tried and are delicious! Then there are the Hawaiian staples: Spam Eggs & Rice, Loco Moco, & Rice Omelette. The menu is pretty big here and you can't go wrong no matter what you get. It all has that home-made Korean food flavor. The Meat Jun is spot on here and I never leave without a belly full of their Jjin Mandu (Steamed Korean Dumplings). You could opt for the fried ones but steaming gives them a more delicate flavor as well as cuts the grease. Those along with the Kim-Chi are made in-house. Portions and Value are definitely better here than at some Korean restaurants.

BAN-CHAN: There's always a bunch of little dishes which is the usual for Korean eating. Kimchi, Radish Kimchi, spinach, potato salad, etc. It seems to vary every single time I come here. But its all good. They don't have a problem refilling them either!

TEA: The type of tea they serve is some random type of Korean root tea. Its delicious. Its not the usual Barley Tea (BoRee Cha). It comes from seeping whole pieces of the root and not some store-bought tea bag.

Spam Musubi: Perfect Hawaiian guilty comfort food. I like to think of it as Hawaiian Foie Gras. :) Not the absolute best version I've ever had but still very good.

Entrees -   

Hot Rock Pot  Bi Bim Bop: Perfect searingly hot bowl of rice, veggies, beef, sunny side up fried egg, chili pepper paste, served w/ a little bowl of sweet soup on the side to cool your throat.

Teriyaki Hamburger: My wife's choice for lunch and though it seemed a  pedestrian choice for such and exotic and extensive menu, she enjoyed it very much and I count her as a burger snob so it must of been good.

I just haadd to say ""delicious"" in both Korean and Hawaiian. 

Island Style is quite the hole-in-the-wall. Now I am aware they have added a new location in the Greenland Supermarket food court, but I urge you to try it's original location first. It's a little mom and pop restaurant located in the middle of an older business complex. It seems very modest from the outside, as the small establishment is covered by highly reflective film on its storefront. Nonetheless, from the moment you walk in, there's a overwhelming feeling of coziness. It is furnished nicely with wood flooring and homely decorations, which provide a nice and warm environment to eat in. It reminds me of being in someones own kitchen, especially since the owners are extremely genuine and welcoming. 

On to the goodies. I've been here several times, and it's often a struggle to decide whether to choose something from the Korean menu or the Hawaiian side. Both are equally solid. I have a few favorites on the Korean side, the stand-outs being the Casseroles and the Cold Buckwheat Noodle soup (Neng Myuhn), which is THE BEST IN TOWN. I live in the far Southwest side of town, and when I get a craving for Neng Myuhn, I take the 20 minute drive without hesitation. For those of you who haven't had this dish, you might be a little intrigued over a noodle-based soup that is served... well, cold. It is mainly a summer dish, but plenty still enjoy it throughout the colder seasons. The ingredients are fairly simple. The soup consists of a beef broth, is chilled, the served with thin and stringy buckwheat noodles. The garnishes are what really tie this dish together; sliced lean beef brisket, julienned cucumber, sliced Asian pears, pickled radish, and half of a hard-boiled egg adorned with sesame seed sprinkles. You are also presented with white vinegar and hot Korean mustard paste, both are things that I add to mine. The reason why Island Style's Buckwheat Noodle soup reigns supreme is because their broth is perfectly seasoned and the noodles glutinous texture is just right, or ""al dente"", if you will. If you haven't had this yet, and are a fan of Korean cuisine, I strongly suggest you try this, regardless of the temperature outside.

Island Style's Hawaiian fare also delivers, and it's apparent because this place is frequented by Vegas's local Hawaiians. I've tried most of their offerings, which consist of the usual favorites. My personal go-to dish tends to be the mixed plate, with the Meat Jun often being the first to disappear from my plate. I do recall them having a few specialty Hawaiian items on Thursdays, such as Kalua Pork & Cabbage and Ahi Poki which were delightful as well. 

There really isn't much else to add, except.... BOILED PEANUTS?! OMNOMNOMNOM. Oh and the Fried Mandu (Pork Dumplings) are also worthy of being labeled best in town. Hand-made daily.

Anyways, Island Style never fails to provide a quality meal in warm, homely atmosphere by owners who really seem to enjoy taking care of their local, and first time customers., nan",3.51,Andrew,36,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

They were really good it had just the right amount of spice in it. 

The Kalbi combo came with macaroni salad and white rice. The portions are pretty big so I ended up taking half of it home. The Kalbi was nice and tender and the mac salad was tasty. I also liked the fact they served regular hamburgers so my husband can eat something that is familiar to him.

Definitely order the Korean dishes! Two recommendations: Jajangmyun (Wheat noodles in a black bean sauce) or Seafood Jangpong (Wheat noodles with spicy broth). Both are well done and good. I came here with my dad, brother, and Ruben and everyone was really happy with their meals. I didn't absolutely love the Chicken Cutlet (Panko-breaded chicken breast AKA Chicken Katsu smothered in brown gravy) or the macaroni salad, both Hawaiian plate lunch staples. That was disappointing, but their execution of the Korean dishes were much better. Not the best Jajangmyun I've had, but not at all shabby. The side dishes (Pahn Chan) were not good, but since these dishes are constantly changing, it may have just been that particular evening. Oh, the Chinese-Style Sweet and Spicy Chicken was good!

The Jajangmyeon (Chinese-style wheat noodles in stir-fried black bean sauce) is still a must and one of my favorite Korean dishes! Last night, the noodles were slightly overcooked and seemed different from the first two times I've had it, but the sauce was on point. It's also just $8.95.

After feeling like the Hawaiian eats were a bust, I ordered the Kalua Pork and Cabbage ($12.95) the last two times and it is delicious! It's one of my favorite Hawaiian dishes, so it has my stamp of approval. The sticky white rice and macaroni salad were good too.

Not surprisingly, the Banchan didn't impress me. I didn't like their kimchi at all and there wasn't anything else memorable. However, we love the complimentary boiled peanuts (another Hawaii ""pupu"" staple)!

Service is wonderful and everything is so quick, which is very good because it gets busy! We were there for dinner on Saturday night around 7:30pm and although there was no wait, the tables were full.

First off, the banchan consisted of the standard cabbage and radish kimchi PLUS boiled peanuts! The boiled peanuts were delicious and complimentary! I had to refrain myself from eating too much so I still had room for the meat jun.

I got the combo, which had the chicken teriyaki, galbi (short ribs), and meat jun. The chicken and galbi is juicy, tender and flavorful, but the meat jun was the real centerpiece.

Meat jun is a fusion dish originating from Korean immigrants in Hawaii I believe. It's basically a tender piece of marinated beef pan-fried with a beaten egg. The marinade is a little sweet and has some soy sauce flavor. It compliments the tender, juicy beef perfectly. Add an egg and it's a unique and tasty dish! Highly recommended!

The tea they serve is very good too. ""Polygonatum tea"" apparently.

Lastly, the service was amazing. The waiter/owner was very attentive with tea refills. He also told us about his experience in Hawaii, the special tea, and the meat jun. 

One of the greatest restaurants in terms of food, service, and even artwork on the walls! Try the meatjun! You won't find it anywhere else!, nan",3.82,Wen,67,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

We were given some ban chan.  We got kalbi, bulgogi and mandu - all of which were good.  I can't say they have the best Korean dishes I've had but I guess for the price, it was reasonable.  I didn't get to try their Hawaiian offerings - I was full.

Service was great.  The server was still nice even though it was crazy busy.  It was a bit loud and people were just chilling with their family.  Laidback atmosphere and not pretentious at all.

I just discovered meat jun on a recent trip to Hawaii with my boyfriend.  I'm so happy that he introduced me to this simple yet super tasty dish that I have just fallen completely in love with.  Thank you Jeremy C.!  Every since I had it at 3 different restaurants in Oahu, I had to find one in Vegas.

Verdict: Island Style does not disappoint.  It is almost as close to the meat jun served at Millions in Oahu.  Flavorful well season beef inside a hefty egg batter served over white rice or fried rice!  Don't forget to dip it in their tasty sauce for an amazing trip in your mouth!

Their dumplings here are a great appetizer too!  And the workers here; I believe a family that used to live in Oahu, are super nice and friendly.  We chopped it up with them about the Islands and food!  My boyfriend and I will definitely be back for the meat jun and to try their other menu items!

Is this how the islands treat everyone because I can get used to this type of hospitality. The day was cold, dreary, and rainy. The service definitely brightened up my party's day. 

I am always craving Korean food and was looking for something on this side of town to meet Katrina M. for her lunch break. My sister and I got there early, so I took the liberty of ordering for everyone. Our very enthusiastic server, and most likely owner, came over to point out some suggestions. Combo plate ($9.90) comes with rice, mac salad,  kalbi, meat jun, and BBQ chicken. Sold, you had me at kalbi. Everything else was an added bonus. Chicken is one of those meats that can be dry, boring, and rarely the highlight of a meal. At Island, it definitely is a contender. Juicy and flavorful. The meat jun was intriguing. A thin slice of beef that has been thrown in an egg batter and browned. It is the first time I have ever had this and it was my sister's favorite off the plate. Brown rice is an option on their menu. We got it subbed instead of regular white and there was no charge. Bonus points! We had also got the bibimnaengmyeon ($9.90). A cold buckwheat noodle tossed in a spicy sweet sauce with radish, cucumber, half a hard boiled egg, and beef slices. I am glad they keep this even in winter. I am usually all for seasonal specialties, but forget that when it comes to this dish. In Korea, this item usually disappears once summer is over. Luckily, not here in Vegas. We had also got the seafood soondubu ($8 something). Bubbling hot, large chunks of tofu, plenty of seafood, and a raw egg dropped in. All good signs... but no kick. I love it best when it possesses a spiciness that can only be remedied with a spoonful of rice. All the dishes come with beansprouts, radish, and cabbage kimchi. The last two items had the same issue, but they were fresh. 

Everyone vowed to come back and try some of the other dishes on the large menu. Even after lunch, I was eyeing the loco moco for next time. 

Hot tea is also complimentary. That is worthy of a mention as well., nan",3.88,David,1046,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

After we put in our order, the table next to us received hot stone dishes with eggs over easy.  Our mouths watered at the sight, since they looked so good. 

The meat jun meat was really tender and had great flavor. Although, I thought it wasn't quite authentic since it had batter plus egg. I've typically had it with just the egg. 

My husband got the spicy noodle soup with beef and vegetables. The noodles had great flavor and the base had the right amount of spicy.

Of all the Korean restaurants that I've been to, this place has to be the best in town! About 10 minutes from the strip, I highly recommend coming here for all your korean OR hawaiian food cravings.   Of course being a Yelpy, I found this on my phone app and noticed their great ratings by a lot of people.  Since bf loves hawaiian food and I absolutely need my kimchi fix at least once a day, this sounded like a perfect place to satisfy both our cravings.  

Don't expect anything fancy.  It's located in a ghetto strip mall with nothing so glitzy like the strip.   But don't let that fool you!  I was skeptical about how their food would taste like when both the server and the owner were NOT korean.  However, once the big slab of kimchi came out along with the other side dishes, it was game over.   Even my mom was very impressed with the way they make their kimchi.  Then again, even my bf who doesn't EVER eat kimchi actually ate it!  Now that's saying a lot about how great and awesome they prepare their kimchi. 

My favorite was their radish kimchi.   We asked for more to take it back to the hotel with us!  

Oh yeah, haven't even said anything about the main dishes yet.  lol  My mom and I shared the hot stone pot rice with veggies.  (dolsot bibimbap)  which was surprisingly good.  I especially loved the little pieces of marinated beef on top of the rice.  

BF got the meat jun which he thought was very yummy.  He gives it 5 stars!  We also shared the fried dumplings and I loved the crispy won ton skin!  The overall experience was very positive and satisfying.    This is our Must Go to place in Vegas!

I started in on the kalbi, tender, well-marinated, very satisfying, but really loved the kimchee and the diced pickled radishes that were served first.  Then tried DH's meat jun.  OMG!  This is a new flavor and texture for me AND it was fantastic!!  Thinly sliced ribeye covered in egg that was fluffy that you dip into a teriyaki sauce.

So my search for amazing Hawaiian food continues on the 9th island called Las Vegas! :D

I've been living in Las Vegas for a month now and every week that goes by,,, I'm coming across new businesses to get my grind on! Love it!

Came here recently with my ex roomie from LA... she never had Hawaiian food before, so it was exciting for me to have her go through the experience with me driving.

I was craving Kalbi, so I went with the Kalbi and meat jun mix plate :)) and I suggested my friend to hit up the fried noodles!

Russell is super nice and to top it off... he's from Hilo on the Big Island... ahhh small world... I'm from Hilo! He knew my uncle too! funny, but not surprising.

Free parking. Casual dining. Indoor seating only. Great customer service. Helper picture menu. 

You'll def find the Aloha spirit here!

I can't wait to come back and try other yummy local food!

Stop by Island Style for your local fix (hawaiian & korean) ... tell Russell I sent you!

Mahalo Island Style for making me feel like I'm still back home in Hawaii!

Really glad we came here despite being a bit skeptical when we first arrived because of the questionable location and plain exterior of the restaurant.

The food was great and definitely satisfied our cravings (we ordered the loco moco, chicken katsu, japchae, spam musubi, and chicken musubi), but the main reason I'm giving this place 5 stars is because of the service. 

We were served by this really friendly guy and although we didn't get his name, he told us his wife owns the restaurant. He recommended a bunch of dishes and ended up giving us a plate of deep fried mandu on the house! Turned out to be a ton of food for three people but that didn't stop him from giving us extra servings of mac salad. Towards the end of our meal he also gave us bottled water and otter pops for free. Such a genuine and nice guy. He also helped us out by giving us a number for a cab service because the company I called said it'd take 1.5 hours lol.

It's definitely the laid-back Hawaiian casual dining you'd find in the Islands, serving awesome Hawaiian & Korean food. 

Prices seem a little bit higher than their competitors, but you easily forget that when your food arrives. The portions are big, plentiful side dishes, and a vast menu, consisting of Loco Moco, fried rice, spam & eggs, to traditional Korean dishes like Bi Bim Bap, spicy tofu soup, and Kalbi. 

Last time I was there, I intended to get take-out. The staff greeted me warmly and saw that I had a grocery bag with me as I looked at the menu. They politely suggested I eat there, and offered to keep my milk chilled in their side fridge. Is that awesome or what?!?! I did end up eating there, ordered the Bi Bim Naeng Myun/Kalbi Combo, and took most of it home. How great was that for them to offer?!

Service I received both visits were great, very friendly, and the staff always thanked and welcomed the customers back soon when they got up to leave.

Not a huge place, 12 tables with 1 flat screen tv for viewing.

I was considering some chicken katsu, meat jun or fried rice til that caught my eye. I settled on black bean noodles. Side dishes included boiled peanuts, bean sprouts, kimchi, fish cake and pan fried hot dog & onions. All were good but the kimchi was a tad bland, probably due to it not being pickled that long. Service was good and my tab was $7+tax, pretty hard to beat for that much food. Rating may change with more visits but I will have to come back and try a few of the other hawaiian local food. I wanted to give this rating 4.5 stars but theres no half star option.

Looking for a restaurant that compares to Island Sushi is difficult in Las Vegas, so I looked for a four plus star restaurant. The restaurant is compact with wooden tables, wooden floor, and little room to move in. I started thinking that maybe I should go to Diamond China for their delicious steamed fish. I got a menu to order take out... Holy!!! Korean food?! Great! I am tempted to order here now being a fellow Korean.

I got the spicy chick (Korean style) with the hopes that it compares with my mother's. Brown rice added. The server came and gave me boiled peanuts and water as I waited for my order. This is the first restaurant in Las Vegas that I have been to with a boiled peanut appetizer. Amazing!!! So far, so good.

Korean spicy chicken is usually only good if the bone(s) are still attached to the chicken. I took some boiled peanuts to go along with some sriracha sauce to mix with the brown rice. The chicken is delicious although it came in chopped thigh pieces (no bones). I was quite amazed at the flavor of the dish. The take out order came with kimchi (kimchi is good, but better at Mr. Tofu) and macaroni salad as well. I think I could have gotten more chicken pieces, but it was definitely worth a try.

Once entering the owner greeted and seated us. He then asked if we had ever eaten there before or a place like it. After giving us some menus he went and got us some boiled peanuts and waters. He explained the menu and gave us recommendations based off what we said we liked. Before our food came out he brought us some cabbage and daikon radish in a slightly spicy sauce which was very tasty along with some bean sprouts. Our food came out very fast and was exactly was amazing. The owner explained how the food was to be eaten and what sauces were best on what foods.

Used to eat here back when I lived in Las Vegas - also when it was Ivan and Gina running the place. I recall really enjoying the food as well as their company/service but heading there for dinner last Saturday with a friend and my parents, I didn't really know what to expect. 

Good food and excellent service is what I got. 

I ordered the Combo plate: kalbi, meat jun, BBQ chicken, rice and macaroni salad. I loved everything but the kalbi. Something about it - no other way to describe it other than I've had better. It was cooked, so I'm not sure if it was the marinade or the quality of the meat - but my friend didn't like it as well and my parents didn't even try it.

The service was awesome. Gina was her usual hospitable self and even brought out some special dishes for the table. 

Everything was awesome except the lack of parking and the kalbi. If I lived in Las Vegas, I'd be a regular for sure; in time, the duke., nan",3.46,Randoll,1280,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Finding this gem and meeting the owner was definitely one of the most memorable parts of our trip to Vegas. The owner, Russel, was closing shop early that day due to a catering gig. We were super lucky to find the place and get there in time to relax and hide from the midsummer heat. On that particular day in Vegas, it was over 110degrees outside and we didnt have AC in our car. All of our sodas and bottled waters were on the house. He fed us like kings, suggested what he thought we would like and then cooked us even more food for free. The whole time he laughed with us and tried to get us to interact with the only other family in the restaurant. He was absolutely the sweetest. Russel took the orders, made all of the food himself., entertained us and prepared for his catering job all at the same time.

When he flipped the sign on the door to close, a man (he explained an annoying regular) came in sometime after and tried to make him feeling guilt for closing early. The terrible man kept nagging, ""Why don't you want to feed my wife?"" Russel fnally yelled at him and kicked him out. It was great. I wish all restaurant owners and workers were able to deal with horrible and demanding customers in such a way.

But I was thoroughly impressed with Island Style.

We didn't end up ordering a lot of the Hawaiian style food, but next time I do want to try the meat jun or the loco moco.

My boyfriend and I ordered naengmyuns and his sister ordered a dolsot (stone pot) bibimbap. It was a hot day! The naengmyun was delicious and so refreshing!!! I really enjoyed it. The bibimbap wasn't bad either. She didn't add in the gochujang (sweet spicy Korean chili sauce) at first because she was intimidated by the deep red spicy-looking color, but once she did, she loved it.

We also ordered a short rib side to share. It wasn't the Korean style galbi I craved with my naengmyun (gal-naeng, anybody?!?), but it was still good.

The banchans were all good as well. And of course, the boiled peanuts were awesome. Flavored just right.

It's definitely a place for the locals. I kind of felt out of place, being from out of town.

The service was on and off. Some of the servers were attentive and good. But the server that took our order completely forgot the sweet and sour pork (tangsooyook) my boyfriend wanted. We ended up cancelling that order because it just never came out. Also, I felt that the Korean workers were nicer to the Koreans.

First of all...this place is the epitome of ""hole in the wall.""

I drove by the place twice, with an address, and zoomed past it.  The neighborhood sucks, but you didn't come here for the scenery!

Once you're in, you will find yourself welcomed warmly and feel right at home.  Not sure if the couple was the owners, my guess yes, but they were very hospitible.

We came here craving Hawaiian...ordered some Katsu and musubi...very good.  I would say the best katsu I have had.  The breading was a lot sweeter and softer compared to most katsu I have had...very very good.  Musubi was good...soft rice and flavorful.

I got suckered into the Bulgogi.  I came wanting Hawaiian, but it has been even longer for Korean.  How does it fair?  Excellent!

Meat was very tender, and I don't know how they did the veggies in the hotplate, but they were sooo good I ate them all.  I am a meat guy...rarely do I eat the veggies...but I made sure they were all gone.  So so good...

You also get all the korean side dishes with the korean food.  The kim chee was very yummy...not quite as bitter and fermented as I am used to...but still very tasty.  The bean sprounts and other dishes were delicious, and their boiled peanuts were also a cool new thing I have never tried before.

 Don't be too quick  to fall for all the fancy hip places my fellow fans of flavor. From Asian Pacific Islanders to East Coasters know that the best places to get your taste buds a fix is that the least suspecting places. This hole in the wall offers not just home run flavor Korean but also many Hawaiian favorites from Chicken Katsu to boiled peanuts. Me & my family have always been big Korean fans and finding a good place in Las Vegas has been hard for quite some time, but when we discovered Island Style we find ourselves stepping in their doors anytime we crave Korean food. 

 The Kalbi is excellent, but my favorite is the Meat Jun! They have plenty of tasty appetizers to pick from, large portions, reasonably prized, and the owners are so friendly! They are always either helping customers or working in the kitchen and their dedication has payed off! Everything I order here is consistently great, and the owners are so friendly they offer great help in making a good choice. 

 I have some Vegan & Vegetarian friends and as much as I love this place it probably wouldn't be my first choice seeing as how it's a largely meat based menu. Overall I back this place hard with 5 stars & if you're local and haven't tried you are missing the boat! Wether it's just you & a friend, or you & a family it's very accommodating and much more spacious than it looks.

My first impression after walking in was relief.  Friendly, open seating in a clean restaurant.  Very kind, friendly service and fellow diners looking relaxed, happy, and enjoying their lovely food.

As soon as I sat down I noticed the man at the next table devouring the Loco Moco which looked so good.  He overheard me comment about it to my friend and told us it was excellent. He then confirmed that anything ordered here is delicious.

My friend, an island girl, had such a hard time choosing a dish...mainly because everything looked so good.  She decided on the Portuguese sausage, rice and egg...requested egg whites only-- no problem.  I didn't even have to look at the menu. The first dish I always select is Bulgogi.  The food came to the table pretty quickly and, wow.  So good!  Perfect flavors, cooked just right.  Ban chan was mmmmmm yummy.  So much food!  The Portuguese sausage was very nice:  full flavor, not greasy, dense, delicious.  My bulgogi was so scrumptious. It was tender, mixed with a delicious blend of onions, carrots, and sesame sprinkled on top.  The kimchee was so good that when we had eaten all of our first small plate we were tempted to pour the juice on our rice and keep on munching.  I made that comment before our second small dish of kimchee came out and my friend told me she had been thinking the same thing.

We are planning on becoming regulars there and bringing our friends.  What impressed me the most was that as dishes were brought out to other tables, they all looked and smelled divine.  I do not think you can go wrong ordering anything. 

The atmosphere was laid back, industrious but not harried, and, yes, loving.  It says a lot that in this kind of town the owners have created a spot where people leave, full, happy, relaxed, and eager to return.  While there, locals, families, foodies, and friends came to eat or pick up orders to go.  This place is well hidden but well-known and my favorite new spot.

So when a Korean person says this place is good, then you know it's good. The wait staff is super friendly and it's like they are family. They served you boiled peanuts while you wait, which is super tasty. The panchan (side dishes) changes day by day. My favorites are the bean sprouts and the Kim chee. They add a refreshing kick in between your bites of hot food. I ordered bi bim bop in the stone pot. The meat, rice and vegetables stayed super hot throughout my whole meal and I had to wait a good 5 minutes for me to even take a bite. The rice at the bottom of the pot gets crispy and adds texture to the meal. My bf had the combo plate which came with kalbi, meat jun and teriyaki chicken. All the meat was tender and full of flavor.

I only came here for lunch because Ko-Mex was closed yesterday. From the outside, the place looks sketchy. However, I was pleasantly surprised at the clean and inviting dining area once we walked in the door. 

For lunch, I chose the Moco-Loco which was layered with steamed rice, a hamburger patty, a fried egg, and brown gravy. I asked for my egg scrambled, not fried. Oh well - I ate it anyways. The dish was good--not great. 

My wife tried the Korean noodle dish-Japchae. We didn't like the texture of the noodles they used for this dish. Imagine the texture of gummi bears while eating noodles. Because they were so spongy, no flavor stuck to them. Who wants to eat plain spongy noodles? Not this guy....

My parents were with us since they were visiting from the Bay Area. They both chose the bibimbap (spelling?) which was a bowl of rice, vegetables, beef, an egg, and spices. The beef inside these bowls was bland, tough, and fatty. Oh, and the side of macaroni salad was way too salty.

The service was spotty. For example, I didn't like that our entrees were coming out one at a time -every 5 minutes.  Plus, I was not offered a drink refill at all during lunch.

he brought us some fresh hot fried dumplings that were really really good. he said they came with the combo plate but I think he was just being nice and letting us try. so good!

Also brought us some kimchi that was really good too.

Food came out quick and hot. good size portion plate. Everything on combo plate was delicious! 
Meat Jun is really really bomb, you just need to dip it in the sauce!!

Surprised by the spicy cold noodle dish my girlfriend ordered, wow it was super good!

BEST PART of the whole experience was great service and homestyle family feel.

Russell asked us if we lived in the area and we told him no we had a long drive back home. 
He boxed up the leftovers real nice for us and then reached in the cooler and hooked it up with two cold bottles of water for the car ride. DUDE what at nice guy yea?

aK8shZb9dEQNyxk5ycfO2A,xxOQ7h6s3InV8o8DOVHlMA,2012-08-15,3.0,"Came here for some take out today because it's always on the top of my best matches when I do a quick search for a lunchtime place, and of course because of the amazing reviews.   I generally like, but do not love Hawaiian and Korean restaurants I have tried, and after eating my Combo Plate with Brown rice, I can say the same for Island Style.

One thing I must say is that getting take out probably diminishes some of the experience and I can easily see it being bumped up to 4 stars with some boiled peanuts and some extra banchan than what was provided with takeout (kimchi only, which was delicious).   Service was top notch for my takeout.   It was packed inside and I was probably a little early and Russell and.... Gina(?) were extremely friendly and did their best to get me my food quickly.   Russell even generously gave me a bottle of water while I was standing there waiting, which was much, much appreciated after the short walk from my car through the flames of hell that was this afternoon's sunshine to the entrance.   He also asked if I wanted hot sauce and I was provided a small container of Sriracha, which is never a bad thing

Opening my takeout container back at the office, I was impressed at the sheer amount of food.   A healthy portion of BBQ Chicken, Ribs, and Meat Jun awaited me.   I liked all three, but didn't love any single one of them at the same time.  

My overall impression was it was a very satisfying meal, but I think for my next visit I'd like to actually sit and eat, take in some of the boiled peanuts and banchan, and maybe try a dish that doesnt translate well to takeout like the Stone Pot Bibimbap (even though I have no idea what the hell it is), nan",3.81,Anthony,151,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

aVYbqZX-yCh2lVBhH3STcA,xxOQ7h6s3InV8o8DOVHlMA,2014-09-29,3.0,"One of a must in any Korean community is the existence of a good jajangmyun and jamppong restaurants.  This is because, unlike most other Korean foods, these dishes are very difficult to replicate at home.  Many good cooks can whip up a good dwenjang jjigae, ddukbokki, or jun, and even more can fire up a kbbq or jungol on their portable gas grill that every Korean family owns.  But trying to perfect the sauces that are the catalysts for these two noodles so that they taste just like the ones from the old country, that is a monumental challenge.  For this reason, jajangmyun restaurants that make great sauces are known by every Korean in that community.  In Vegas, apparently there is Island Style.

I guess to non-Koreans this is a Hawaiian place?  But in the Korean community, this place is known as Baek Li Hyang, a Korean-Chinese restaurant that serves up Jajangmyun, jamppong, and tang soo yook (sweet & sour pork, Korean style).  They also have other Korean dishes, one of which I noticed is the beef jun.  We were here specifically for the noodles, and thus ordered a dish of each.  Expectations were high because we heard consistently that this is the best Chinese noodle restaurant in the valley.  As a result, disappointment was also high as we realized that it was not going to meet those expectations.

First the good.  Jamppong is pretty good.  The soup has that requisite taste required, and the ingredients were ample with fresh and plump seafood pieces.  The deep red color is accompanied by an equally deep taste, although not quite as spicy as it appears.  Now the mediocre.  The noodle on both dishes were just okay, not as firm and chewy as it should be indicating it's not handmade.  Take note, noodles are a big differentiator in these two dishes.  When they are not proper, it will ""tire out"" the dish.  This will result in the symptom where you will initially like it, but then find yourself not finishing the dish.  It was such here.  The bad is the jajang sauce.  It was too sweet, and did not possess that distinct taste required to qualify as good jajangmyun.  The combination of that sauce with the noodles made it at best an okay dish.  

The bare set up did nothing to enhance the experience, but the servers were pleasant.  While the Korean-Chinese dishes we had were only mediocre, I'm wondering if there is something that they to well since the place was decently busy.  Maybe I will give it another go on some of the other dishes... But based on what we had, I can't do any better than 3 stars.

Table-for-1 Factor:  Absolutely fine to eat by yourself here, both the atmosphere and the dishes are set up for it., nan",3.78,Benjamin,205,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

This hole-in-the-wall is nestled amongst the seedy massage parlors and stripper clothing stores. GPS led me right to it. They are opening a new location at Spring Mtn. and Rainbow this week, so try that one if you're looking for more ambiances. 

Korean food in Vegas is usually sub par and way over priced. This place was a complete surprise and a wonderful new experience. Not a place to take a first date, but a great place for home-style Korean and Hawaiian food. The menu said fusion, but the dishes were not really fused. Korean food was just like mom makes, and the Hawaiian food was just like I've had in Hawaii. Didn't see anything like Moco Kim-chee bap. 

My group of 5 enjoyed everything we ordered. Here is the breakdown:

Me - I ordered the Loco Moco. Although I've only had it at chain stores like L&L and Ono Hawaiian, I can say that Island Style's is hands down the BEST. The gravy is awesome. It is Loco Moco, so I'm definitely going to gain a few lbs from it, but it wasn't as heavy as the chain versions. Highly recommend. 

Wife - Soon Du Boo. Excellent. Just like the local spots in L.A. Very authentic. 

Daughter (6yrs old) - Spam and eggs. ""Yummeee!!"". If you like Spam and eggs, how can they get it wrong? 

Sister - Curry lover say the curry is as close to home made as she's had. She is so picky that she doesn't even like Curry House. 

Mom - Madu Guk. Even my mom was impressed with the taste. She said it tasted really homemade. 

Overall a wonderful place to stop to get a great meal that tastes very authentic.  Husband is from Hawaii, and the wife id Korean, so they really know what they're doing. The fact that the menu had both styles made me real nervous, but the tastes were not sacrificed in any way. The hospitably was top notch. Both the husband and wife were super friendly and overly generous with the side dishes, tea, boiled peanuts, and even gave a dish of fried wontons for us to sample. The kim-chee was super authentic and the pickled cucumber was awesome. As soon as we got close to finishing a dish, they brought out another heaping dish.

We pulled into the parking lot and I thought I would just run in and see if they had a to go menu so we could look over a menu to see if we truly wanted to eat here. They didn't have one but the lady told me to take my time and look over one of their menus. 

Instead, I just went back to the car and told my hunny and son to come in. I mean we were here already, why not. 

They were pretty busy when we first got there, or so I thought.  Time would teach me very well that I was wrong in my assumption.

Glancing over the menus, they have a good selection of items. Mostly Korean with hint of Hawaiian items. What won me over is that they had American items for me to choose from for my son. 

I settled on the hot rock bi mi map and my hunny got a regular bi mi map and for an appetizer we order Mandu. The kiddo got fries.

While we were waiting on our Mandu we were served some boiled peanuts which were so good. Art kind of looked at them weird because he had never had them but once he tried one he couldn't stop eating them.

Next came our cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, sesame bean sprouts, and some kind of stir fried hot dog.

I am a HUGE KIMCHI FREAK. This stuff was amazing. Other than it needing more heat (for my taste) it was extremely flavorful and still crunchy. I basically inhaled Kimchi and kept eying a jar that they had filled in fridge with that stuff and wondered how much they would have sold that jar to me for. 

I concentrated on the kimchi for so long, I didn't realize that Art had ate almost all the mandu and bean sprouts. Mandu had come out sometime while  I was lost in heaven eating that kimchi.

I was pleasantly surprised with the mandu. I didn't know what to expect for the filling but it was a noodle, veggie mixture deep fried in a pot sticker wrapper. They were hot and crunchy on the outside and soft and delicious on the inside. 

My hot rock bi mi map came out and you could just hear the sizzle and smell the rice getting slightly burnt and crunchy. They dressed my bi mi map once it arrived to the table and that was nice. 

Art's bi mi map came in a huge white bowl and looked almost better than mine but I knew that I had the crispy rice to look forward to. My egg was slightly under cooked so it could finish cooking in the hot rock. My mouth is literally salivating now just thinking about it. It had a nice combo of meat and veggies in it. I meant to take a picture of it but I couldn't stop eating it.

When they brought out my son's fries they were sure to tell me that they didn't put any salt on it. I thought this was very considerate. They even brought him an otter pop at the end of our meal.

I don't know if our bowls were too big or we filled our selves on kimchi, peanuts and beansprouts and mandu but we had to go take half of our bi mi maps to go.

This place was a big hit for me and the fact that it was a huge hit for my hunny says a lot too. He doesn't love Asian food as much as me, so this definitely says a lot. 

The only downfall to this place is that they are small and get crowded, I mean no seats available crowded FAST! At least they did the night we were there. 

We will definitely be back. There are no ifs ands or butts about this. I want to go back and try some of that fried fish and bulgolgi I was eying on other plates., nan",3.62,Debra,314,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Service was awesome. Russell the owner was so friendly! He makes you feel like he appreciates your business.  

Between the Hubby and I, we tried the combo plate (kalbi, BBQ chicken, meat Jun), hamburger steak, macaroni salad, mandoo, kim chee, daikon and bean sprouts. They were all outstanding. And Hubby likey very much. Kim chee never tasted so fresh and I don't even like bean sprouts.

Approach a restaurant that looks both scary and closed.
Open the door and catch a whiff of food that will make your belly happy.

Best dive in Las Vegas! 
And maybe even some of the best ethnic food in Las Vegas.

I had the bulgogi. It was a generous portion of bulgogi done right and seasoned to perfection. Heaping mounds of white rice, and the even the usually dreaded Hawaiian macaroni salad was good.

But the best part? The owner made me feel like an honored guest, bringing me 4 kinds of homemade kimchi, some kind of Korean tea, boiled peanuts. 

I love people who are passionate about what they do. I love people who are passionate about serving up great food. And I love people who put care and love into their food, whether it's a fancy restaurant, or a little dive in an unlikely and nearly frightening location.

When we walked in, the tables were all packed with huge families and friend groups, showing you that this is a place you share with loved ones.  We were seated quickly and when the waiter came over, he asked if we had any questions about the menu (considering that half of it is written in an Asian language, I'm sure this is probably a concern!).  We ordered the Japchae, Combo plate, and a spam masubi.

A few seconds later, the waiter comes back with all these complimentary apps!  What?!?!  Awesome surprise.  There were boiled peanuts, anchovies, bean sprouts, and radish/cucumber/bok choy kim chee.  I liked the bean sprouts the best; the dressing on it reminded me of seaweed salad.

Then we got our food.  The spam masubi was a nice huge chuck of rice, spam, and seaweed.  The Japchae was a very large serving and it had some out of this world mushrooms and bulgogi in there.  The noodles were sweet and slightly chewy; an interesting texture.  The combo plate was excellent, a great way to try a little of everything so you know what you like.  The BBQ chicken was my favorite, and the kalbi beef was juicy and flavorful.  The Jun meat was not my cup of tea, I didn't like the egg batter.  Of course, I was really excited about the mac salad: very tasty and black peppery.

I have to say someting about the waiter, because he is really what made this such an enjoyable experience.  I think he knew it was our first time there, so he kept giving us hints about what was good and how to eat some of the stuff.  He was sooo laid back, kind, funny, and welcoming, like we were best friends or something!  At the end of the night, the door opened and a big gust of cold wind came in.  My husband, who refuses to wear jackets, shivered and the waiter gave him some tea in a to-go cup to warm him up on the way to the car.

Best decision ever!

Do not be fooled by the shabby exterior on a strip mall. 

The interior is nothing impressive either. But I'm not there for ambience. It's the food that I'm there for. And it surely delivered!

The moment we sat down, we were served the ban chan by the very friendly owner. He was such a joy! He was very patient and helpful and explained to us what we have in front of us. These little plates of appetizers were yummy! My favorite was the white crunch seaweed that looked like noodles. 

The owner suggested some yummy specials but since we practice only halal/kosher meat, we opted for the seafood options. My husband is not too adventurous so he got the salmon teriyaki. We got our son the fish katsu and I got the spicy grilled octopus. 

Food didn't take too long. Our son's fish katsu came undercooked and it was promptly fixed by the owner who was so apologetic. 

He later even offered us canned Hawaiian drinks on the house.

Quick example of the hospitality and service we received before I review how wonderful the food is...We arrived just before noon and made our way to a corner table next to the soda cooler. There was another patron waiting for her carry out order sitting next to us. While we were looking at the menu, the carry out order came out and the customer left. Before we knew it, Russell came out and insisted we moved to the next table. He was concerned that we'd be uncomfortable from the heat coming off the refrigerator. It may not seem like a big thing, but just the fact he'd go out of his way to make sure we were comfortable before we could feel any discomfort was so refreshing! I read all the other reviews talking about how genuine Russell is, but you can't believe it until you experience it.

Now, the food! After reading other reviews, I needed to make sure we sampled as much as we could and I can honestly say Russell delivers! My oldest son had the combo (bbq chicken, kalbi ribs, and meat jun), my youngest had the saimin, my wife the spicy beef soup, and I had the Bi Bim Bap. I'm am so happy we tried all the different dishes. No one was disappointed with what they got. The food came out fast, hot, and in huge portions. It was everything we could hope for and then some.

One other observation I can't pass up. The place has such a neighborhood feel to it. The dining room filled up quickly after we arrived with locals that were obvious regulars.  It almost felt like a backwards ""Cheers"". Instead of everyone greeting Norm coming to the bar, greetings of ""Hey Russell!"" from the majority of the people walking in the door!

Russell is so inviting and his food is so comforting, I wish him nothing but years of success. I know I'll be back as soon as we go back to Vegas! Mahalo!, nan",4.91,Brian,9,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

My favorite parts of a Korean meal are the complimentary banchan plates and hot tea and this place delivered. The standard kimchi, sprouts, and pickled cucumbers tasted sour and ""fresh"". Surprises included tasty diced franks sautéed with onions; boiled peanuts; steamed broccoli; and salty, dried tiny fish. But don't expect all of this in one meal. Every visit yielded different banchan plates and that's totally fine in my book. 

The signature bibimbap was executed very well. It's served hot and the medley of diced vegetables, sliced steak, steamed rice, and a fried egg came out perfectly like Kim Yuna landing a triple lutz. The serving size is ridiculously generous and I NEVER finished.  It's served two ways: regular bowl ($8.95) and hot spot ($9.95). I personally liked the regular bowl better because the hot pot can turn the rice super crispy and that those little suckers will get stuck in your molars. But the hot pot is fanciful and the sizzling caused me to oohh and ahhh.

I got a pork cutlet so I can try out some of their gravy. It's all about the gravy and a weak gravy makes for a okay dish. The gravy here was good on my katsu.

For lunch I decided to get the Combo due to the reviews here. The steamed peanuts were very nice and Russel gave me tons (too many given how much food was yet to come). The pickled radish was great, but the kimchi was a bit bland and squishy. But when Russel saw me eating the kimchi he asked if I liked kimchi and I said yes. He then brought out a large leaf of cabbage and cut it into pieces for me at the table. It turned out to be kimchi that was aged longer and it was wonderful! Nice and crisp with a good bite and more heat. 

Then the Combo came. The portions were very generous and I enjoyed everything. I sadly couldn't finish the macaroni salad because I was stuffed. Russel then brought out a bunch of sheets of dried seaweed and I finished them off. They were a perfect light salty ending to the meal. Then when I paid he charged me only for the combo, adding nothing for the extra kimchi and seaweed.

That night I had the Saimin (noodle soup). The noodles were very well cooked with just enough firmness. The soup was tasty, and the small bowl was plenty given that I had stuffed myself at lunch.

Food from the 808.  Well kinda.  More like Korean take out and a spam musubi on the side for good measure.  

Rant:
1.  Hawaiian food and the iconic plate lunch is NOT Korean take out with four choices of vegetables.
2.  Stop throwing pineapples on everything and calling it ""Hawaiian"".
3.  Just because they say it on Hawaii Five-0, calling me ""brah"" or asking if I ""hang ten"" does not make you cool, it just makes you sound stupid.

How does it stack up?

Excluding the more traditional Korean items, these are island flavors.  Heavy handed on the salt and MSG, lots of sweetened shoyu (soy sauce) infused with ginger and garlic marinades.  Portions are West coast sensible, no two pound plate lunch.

Kalbi, meat jun, BBQ beef, BBQ chicken all greasy, oily, and deeply flavored.  Two scoops rice, macaroni salad, some Korean style veg.  Done.  Hawaii Yeeps, think Yummys.
 
A bowl of saimin (not ramen) with slices of spam, egg, kamaboko maybe some won ton and green onion in a supercharged MSG based bonito broth taste like Shiro's.  Exactly as it should.  The fried version, oily, salty and plain.  Hawaii hotel banquet quality.

A group of us were celebrating our birthdays in Las Vegas and we wanted to try something off the beaten path.  We were all in the mood for Peruvian, yet the place we loved had closed last year.  We hopped on yelp and this is how we came upon Island Style Restaurant.  It was not far from our hotel on the strip, so in minutes we were at the restaurant.  I have to say, do not let the exterior of the building deter you or you'll really be missing out on some great service and tasty food!

As we entered, we were quickly greeted by a gentleman with a big smile, asking us if we were hungry?  He quickly sat us and we were given menus and asked what we'd like to drink.  As we waited for drinks, I couldn't help but noticing the food pictures on the wall.  I'm not  big on ordering your meal by the picture, yet that is exactly what I did. It all looked SO GOOD!  We were brought 4 different types of kim chi type vegetables and some boiled peanuts. I can still taste them! Yum!

As we asked plenty of questions about the menu, our server, who ended up being the owner, patiently answered all of them making suggestion as we went.  We made a joke about wanting to try it all, and he said ""Let's do it!""  He was excited that we were excited to eat and try new things. OK...now to the order.

We started off with an appetizer and I'm not sure what they were called, yet they reminded me of an empenada. They were hand made that day, and I regret not taking an order to go!  As for the entrees, my friend and I both ordered the meat combo: egg battered ribeye, short-rib and chicken with spam fried rice. If you love meat, this is your dish!  I am not a spam guy, but the spam fried rice was SO good!  Another had this meat over a bed of rice dish smothered in a thin beef gravy.  I forgot the name, yet it was DELISH!  Our last order wasn't even on the menu.  One of us was hung over, so the owner said, ""Let me make you something to cure that hangover.""  He brought out this big bowl of soup for my friend, and after tasting it, I ordered a small bowl myself!

All in all, a tremendously positive, inexpensive experience with solid, good tasting food!  We have found our new lunch spot in Vegas!

I try to not to eat out as much to stay healthy, so my options are limited, decided to get Korean food and found Island style on yelp.  This place is located at the middle of a line of shopping stores, it will take an extra second to find it but not hard following the gps.  Also since it is in Vegas, all the windows got black screens to block the Sun, so you wouldn't be able to look inside, I had to double checked the sign few times before I walked in.  

It is a little warm inside but it is in the middle of the summer in Vegas.  The waitress gave me 2 menus and when she found out that I was eating by myself she was surprised and started to talk to me.  I told her I visited Korea a while back and how much I loved Korea, she told me to find a Korean girlfriend and move to Korea. Very friendly and funny, then I decided to get the cold noodle soup.  The soup was really good, almost as good as the one I had in Korea.  Since I been back to the States I tried few the same dish in different locations in California but they were a bit disappointing.  

I really want to try the black beans noodle but I will give that a try next time.  Actually there are many items on the menu that I want to try.  Great food with friendly staff, I will come back for sure., nan",3.63,Peter,208,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

I met the owner and Chef, she's a sweetheart and a very good cook! The place was filled with Asians, which is a GOOD THING. If the people of it's own ethnicity are eating there, than you know it's a good staple of Korean Cuisine. 

There's plenty of room to sit, and they start you off with KIM CHI, Cucumbers, and Boiled Peanuts for appetizers. Nice veggies to wet the palate. I had the Combo dish, which was outstanding!! Teriyaki Chicken, grilled Short Rib, and an Egg fried Steak over white rice served with the perfect Hawaiian Guava Passion fruit juice drink. 

I tried my wife's dish which was the Spicy Pork with white rice. FIRE!! ABSOLUTE FIRE! Perfectly tender pork loin smothered in a spicy/sweet sauce. I tell ya, the taste of that had me smiling. 

Customer service is VERY GOOD! They are all very helpful and fast, so please be ready to order!

I came here with my Korean friend who did all the ordering, thank goodness else I wouldn't have known what to get. My parents have told me before that Chinese and Korean culture have many similarities, but I never really paid much attention. Not probably until I ate at Island Style, which happens to be a Chinese Korean fusion restaurant. There are many dishes that crossover into both cultures, and each style has a different spin to it. There's also Hawaiian too though. So it's easy to be all sorts of confused here. But hey, food is food. And as long as it's good, I really don't care what culture wants to claim it. 

We had tangsooyuk (sweet and sour pork) and Jjamjjamyun - a combo of their two house specialties jjajangmyun (noodles with black bean sauce) and jjampong (spicy seafood noodle soup). The pork was crispy and well seasoned and came with vegetables. I think the Chinese rendition leaves bone in and doesn't have vegetables. Flavors are similar but there's a different kick to this one, and there's a sauce you're meant to dip it in. Both types of noodles were good. I've never had jjampong, but jjajangmyun (the black one) is a Chinese dish I'm pretty familiar with. Here, the sauce is dark and you can't really tell what's inside it. You get to choose what kind of meat you want. The flavors were so good. In the Chinese version, there's a lot more diced vegetables and tofu along with minced meat. I'd order both versions depending on my mood. The seafood noodle was spicy but also delicious. There was a huge amount of seafood in there, including mussel, shrimp, crab legs, and squid. I really enjoyed all the food. 

The venue is very casual. Nice staff. Laid back seating. Clean bathrooms. Outside can be a little shady if it's late at night since it's not the busiest and most well lit area. But it's not bad. 

Overall I'd come back., nan",3.78,Bonnie,235,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

It's a little off the strip, but I think it's definitely worth trying. It's located in a small sketchy looking plaza, and may get crowded at times.

I ordered the bulgogi plate whereas my friends got the meat jun combo. Our meals came with a small assortment of fresh banchan. I really liked the kimchi, seaweed salad, and boiled nuts. Before our entrees came out, I was already full from stuffing myself with the banchan. 

The bulgogi was very delicious! I enjoyed every little bit of it - even the leftovers. The meat jun was pretty good as well. And all for around $10. What a steal! My only gripe is that they mixed up my order, which led to a bit of a delay with my entree. But luckily the banchan was there to satisfy me in the meantime.

iRRwoWWkZ2o3FaI7i6tcwQ,xxOQ7h6s3InV8o8DOVHlMA,2012-06-13,5.0,"I'm no Korean/Hawaiian food expert, but this place has lived up to the hype.  Thanks Jade for the recommendation.  Myself and a few coworkers came here today, and not a single one of us wasn't impressed.

First off, the kimchi is bomb here.  I can usually leave out the kimchi, but that's only because so many places in Vegas have mediocre kimchi.  Not this kimchi.  You'll get this as an appetizer, so even if you are not a kimchi person you have to try it.  Our server (the owner?) sensed my coworker's enthusiasm over the kimchi, being the kimchi fanatic that he is, and complimented us some dumplings.  Off the hook.  The crust was kind of thick, but not greasy at all.  The meat was delicious, great spice and herb flavor.  A good sign of things to come...

I ordered the Hot Rock Bi Bim Bap.  Friggin tasty.  Quality beef, super fresh veggies, and really nice Kochujang(?) sauce.  The Kochujang was slightly sweet but not too sweet, and subtly flavored.  What set this dish apart for me was the high quality for just around $10.00.  Oh, and don't forget the crystallized rice grains at the bottom. Despite gorging myself on refills of kimchi, I couldn't stop eating the Bi Bim Bap until every last rice grain was gone.  Just a great version of this classic Korean dish!

I also managed to taste my friend's bulgolgi.  I normally don't like bulgolgi because it is always tough and overly sauced.  Not this bulgolgi, which is the best I have ever had.  VERY tender, and expertly seasoned.  The sauce was light and of a homemade quality.  Just delicious!

Again, special thanks to Jade and the other Yelpers.  I don't know why it has taken me so long to try Island Style.  If you don't know if you like Korean food, this is the place to try it.  If you don't always feel like Korean food, this is the place to go when you do.  If you are a Korean food snob, give Island Style a try and let me know what you think!, nan",3.7,Dan,162,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Great friendly service and delicious Korean and Hawaiian food that just screams out home-cooking. They provide boiled peanuts in the beginning on top of the regular banchan! There's also barley tea at times. 

This place is pretty nostalgic for me. It popped my soon dubu cherry and I've been a fan of the dish ever since I tried it here! The owner is super friendly and unique with his Hawaiian-style hospitality. I haven't seen the son around recently but he used to work there and would pimp out my mul naengmyun with greens and spices! Good 'ol days.

Lately I've been going there for the mul naengmyun. My boyfriend loves the jjajangmyun there. They expanded as well, taking over the Hawaiian souvenier store next door. Some of the tables have become a cafeteria style where you may end up sitting next to strangers. I think it's kind of cute and nostalgic. 

Island style is definitely a local favorite, having been here for so long and providing consistently awesome service and delicious food. My only gripe is that it's more expensive than most other Korean restaurants I go to but you know what to expect here. There are also TV's for your viewing pleasure.

Well for one, I can say is this: For the price, the large quantity, taste and quality and great customer service gives this place a 5 star and no less.  A must try for the newbies out their is the meatjun, fantastic! They recently added a Chinese Menu which, unfortunately, makes it much more difficult to decide what to eat.  If you aren't sure what you're appetite is feeling like, the server an owners spend more than enough time to explain everything on the menu. 

Seating is sometimes limited due to locals who eat here on a daily basis but do not fear, expansion is near! The owners informed me that they will be expanding the restaurant this year to maximize seating occupancy! If you do find yourself waiting for a table however, the servers treat you with their famous boiled peanuts as an appetizer for the wait. They are also very attentive to their customers and always work quick to keep their customers satisfied.

This was a true lesson in ""not judging a book by its cover"".  When we pulled up into the sketchy parking lot of Island Style, my husband had some hesitation and suggested we go somewhere else.  But, I told him that people I trusted on Yelp recommended it- so let's just take a look.  Well, when we opened the door- we were welcomed by the owner, Russell like we were ""ohana""- and the place was pretty packed with Korean, Filipino, and Hawaiian diners. 

I am so glad we stepped inside because it truly reminded me of my favorite family owned restaurants in Hawaii! I ordered the combo plate and instantly fell in love with the Meat Jun.  It was my first time trying it, and it will definitely not be my last.  My husband ordered the Stone-Pot Bimimbap and said it was the best he has ever had.  We also ordered a couple Spam Musubi because I can't eat hawaiian food without having some good ol' spam, and the seaweed wrapper was perfectly crunchy. Throw in some delicious good sized plates of banchan- and we were a happy bunch.  If I didn't show some restraint, I would have filled up completely on the kimchi (which is homemade by his wife). 

Russell's friendly hospitality was awesome. He even offered to change the TV channel to some cartoons for our toddler- but I told him to leave it on Jeopardy because if she is watching TV, she won't eat. We chatted a bit, and he told us that his wife runs the Island Style at Greenland Market.  Well, the next day- we actually made a trip down to Greenland- and my husband ordered a plate of Meat Jun just for himself this time and loved every bite!, nan",3.87,Rosemarie,275,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Island Style was easy to find, there was plenty of parking, the outside looked kinda scary but I wasn't going to let that stop me from my new culinary adventure. Inside was full of tables to pick from that later on became occupied. The server which I think was the owner was super nice and greeted as very quickly with water and a bowl of boiled peanuts. I'm allergic but I tried the peanuts, they were tasty and salty. 

The menu was sorta divided with Hawaiian/Korean dishes. I ordered some crunchy mandu to start with; they are meat filled half shaped moon dumplings that resemble Japanese gioza, they were very flavorful. Our server arrived with four Korean side dishes of unexpected banchan. The banchan included kimchi, radish cubes kimchi style, mung bean sprouts, and vienna sausages. I decided to order the famous bulgogi which I haven't had in more than 4 years since my last trip to Korea. The bulgogi was right on point just like I've had it in the past but smothered in onions which I just pushed to the side. I also got to try the katsu chicken, it was so good and crunchy, I didn't care too much for the sauce but it was decent. Both entrees came with a side of rice and macaroni salad. 

This place was way tastier than Island Flavor, their macaroni salad was to die for, it wasn't bland at all. Our server came to check on us and asked us if we wanted refills on the banchan! Anywhere else they charge you but not this awesome joint. We were even offered hot tea but it was kinda warm inside so we skipped it. I can defenately keep coming back to this place.

First off, if you are not actively looking for their sign, you are definitely gonna miss it. Even when I parked, I still had to look around for what door I had to go in. The door to their restaurant isnt labeled. So after sticking my head in there, I confirmed it. 

So I sit down and the nice lady hands me a menu. Just like that they put a small to go box of boiled peanuts on your table. I guess you can take it home if you dont finish? Nice. They also give you a glass of water by default. Also nice. But thats where I notice my good experience ends.

I ordered Beef Teriyaki. They bring it out accompanied with a sampler plate of kim chi which consisted of cabbage, bean sprouts, some kind of radish, and sliced hot dogs? As for the Teriyaki Beef, they actually give you a decent amount of beef and rice. (refer to my pic). 

I probably would of enjoyed my meal better if I got a refill or two on my water. As soon as I got my food, the next time I saw the server, she was bringing out my check. I asked nicely for a refill on my water. I decided to pay with cash for I had a feeling it was gonna take a while for her to come back with my refill thinking that charging my card will also take some time. I wasnt in any rush or anything but there were people waiting to sit down and eat.

I mean, honestly, I've only tried a handful of Korean dishes, and probably couldn't tell you much about them other than a brief description. But I stick to what I love and know best: meat and noodles.

My brother and I met Katrina M. here for a lunch date - welcomed warmly on such a dreary day. We ordered the Meat Combo plate ($9.90) that came with Meat Jun, BBQ Chicken, Kalbi, macaroni salad and rice. Then, of course, we ordered my spicy cold noodles ($9.90) and a sauntering pot of seafood soup for Katrina M. 

I was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed all the meat options - the Meat Jun unexpectedly becoming my favorite. Egg battered beef, it was tender and bursting with flavor. The chicken was moist and flavorful, and kalbi is always good. But my cold buckwheat noodles - they were perfection. The balance of spice and acidity warming me up perfectly on a ""Seattle"" day.

What really made this trip to Island Style was the hospitality. Warmly greeted by both the proprietor and his never-ending supply of hot barley tea, I felt like I could sit there forever, taking shelter from the sporadic weather, eating my spicy noodles in bliss., nan",4.14,Diana,129,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

We got the dumplings (beef), the combo plate, and a musubi. The dumplings were delicious. The dipping sauce was amazing. The combo plate was good. The BBQ chicken was awesome! Great flavor and cooked perfectly. The same goes for the short ribs. I wasn't really fond of the Meat Jun, though people on here rave about it. Didn't pack a lot of flavor and the taste of egg seemed to overpower the taste of the meat. The musubi was great as well, though seemed to lack sauce.

I do love the fact that they give you boiled peanuts.  I haven't had those since ""small keed time"" in Hawaii.  Very nostalgic.  The service is fair, the waiter speaking pidgin.  The food is pretty good. We had the homemade mandoo because we saw the lady making them last time.  The meat jun was on the tough side.  I think the beef needs to be sliced thinner for that.  

My main complaint is with the kim chee.  It was slimy and not very hot or flavorful.  I didn't even touch it after the first bite, and I am usually the one to polish the thing off.  Maybe I just got a bad batch, but in my opinion, having good kim chee is essential for a Korean restaurant.  My second complaint, no restroom!

I used to go to this place with my Korean friends and family for naeng-myun and other Korean dishes. Today, there was this non-Korean, Hawaiian (I think) person working and was absolutely rude! I was short on time, had a 40 minutes lunch break and since Island- style was right across the stress, I was thinking 35 mins should be plenty of time to eat my food and leave. I was waiting over 20 mins for my food and I understand there were a few orders ahead of me and by looking at everyone else's food, it does take time to cook. After 15mins passed by I asked the guy if it would take long cause I only had 15 mins left to eat and go back. He did said he would check on it then left. Approx 10 more minutes passed by I gave him my credit card so it would be faster if I ate and left. He told me that it takes time to make my buckwheat noodles and that everything was made to order. Ughhh.... buddy I'm Korean and I know damn well that it only takes 30 secs once in boiling water to cook the noodles and put in the broth. Needless to say I took one bite of the cold noodle and it wasn't hand made, it was the store bought noodles you cook in boiling water. The broth was so salty, and the spicy buckwheat noodles tasted like pure hot pepper paste + vinegar and again salty. I took literally two bites and left. The guy who took my order grabbed the checkbook from me and told customers next to me 'shes telling me how to cook brah...'. I know you've been cooking for 19 years BUT if you knew anything about customer service you do not talk shit when I can clearly hear you, grab the checkbook out of my hand, and give me dirty looks. Everytime I came here its the owners that now operate the one at Greenland. They are soo nice and helpful... total opposite of this guy... oh yea btw your Nengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles in broth) and Bibim gook-so (spicy, cold buckwheat noodles) is tasteless... 

If this guy didn't offend me so much, I would come back for their Hawaiian plate lunch, it looked really good.

The food, man. The FOOD! Bi bim bop hot pot--a stone pot with crunchy rice on the bottom, and piled with noodles, veggies, teriyaki beef, and an egg on top. I don't even like eggs but I had to go for it, mixed it all in, and I wasn't sorry. My friend had the beef jun--beef fried in a thin egg batter, unique and amazing. We were also plied with many appetizer things, just because: five different kinds of kimchi--including an extra fresh serving that the owner brought out, boiled peanuts (realllllly good), and we also ordered the fried potstickers--also done with their own unique crunchy goodness.

The service, brah. The SERVICE! From the moment me and my four pals came in, we were treated like friends. The owners took the time to ask us our preferences, explain stuff to us (because they could tell this was somewhat new to us), and brought out extra things when we reacted so gratefully to the other things they put on the table. And they just acted like we were their buds. It's been too long since I've had this kind of friendliness at a restaurant.

The vibe, mate, the viiiiiiibe. Yes, when you drive up you will look at the joint from the outside and say, ""Is this place open? Is this place even legit?"" (the window isn't see-through so it looks almost like it's being remodeled or something). But when you push through the door, everything changes: It's well-lit, clean and bright, and almost cozy. There's a happy greeting from the staff, and a comfortable hawaiian vibe.

We ate at many good places on our Vegas weekend, but this was the one where every so often when we were contemplating our next meal, someone would say, ""Hey we could always go back to Island Style..."" In fact, even before I was halfway through my hot pot, I was thinking about how and when I could come back again.  

Go here. Unlike many other cheap eats, it's not a dive, it's not greasy, and the food isn't just good for the price. It's GOOD.

This place has been in Vegas for about 17 years (give or take) and have never heard about it till now! I'm from Hawai'i and I haven't heard about it from my fam and Hawaiian friends that live here. I only found out about it thru a friend (who's originally from NY). Maybe I use to go here with an ex and I just blocked it all out from my memory. Lol. 

it's a small place, and easy to miss when your driving down sahara in traffic and all the construction. Once we got there, it was not busy, a quiet relaxing place to have a meal. They got a wide screen tv w/ the basketball game on. 

We were greeted and served by the owner. He got the pidgin accent. I love that, always make me feel like I'm back home. the menu is simple, that's good for people like me who can love everything on the menu and have a hard time deciding what to get. 

This is the first place I've been to that has fish jun! My favorite Korean-Hawaiian dish is meat jun, but I wanted to try this. I'm the adventurous type so I always like to try new things. 

I like the appetizers here. It's different than other Korean restaurants. They got the kimchee, pickled potatoes?, and some other ones. They were all soooo good! I couldn't eat a lot of it, so I stuffed the rest in my take out box hehe. My friends didn't care for it, lucky me... I had it all to myself! 

I appreciate it when the owners are able to serve and chat a little bit with us. it seems humble. 

I told him I love meat jun, but this is the first time I've had fish jun. He said the next time we come in he'll make zucchini jun for us, right on!!! it's not on the menu. 

The meat jun is pretty good, but Soon's meat jun  in salt lake, Oahu, Hawai'i tops my list. but this will be my go to spot for anything jun in Vegas. 

Oh yah, I like that they give a delicious tea at the end of your meal, no charge. :)

One con is that it's a bit of a drive for me coming from east Henderson. maybe that's another reason why I've haven't heard about this place.

Ordered:
-Combo plate w fried rice
-Mool naeng myun (cold noodle)
-Chili japchae

The combo plate was the best bang for buck. The galbi, meat jun, fried rice were all good.. not amazing. Mool naeng myun was terrible. I usually don't order it unless I'm really in the mood, because I haven't found many places outside of Korea that can make this well. Unfortunately, I happened to be in the mood for it. Sometimes I can tolerate it by adding vinegar and mustard to cover most of the taste. This one didn't taste like much of anything even after adding the mustard and vinegar. Probably one of the worst / bottom five.

We ordered chili japchae which we thought was regular japchae with peppers to add a kick. Instead, it was stir fried onions and peppers, which confused us. It tasted like a thai dish I've had and was pretty good, but not what we expected at all.

The kimchi was good, so I wouldn't mind buying this to-go., nan",3.17,Esther,47,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

Never really thought much about Hawaiian -Korean food, but it is great. 
When you come in you get a basket of boiled, salted peanuts. Not really my cup of tea, but it's always nice when they bring out something to nibble on while you wait for the main dish. Gotta appreciate that. 

The meat was grilled with onions, green onions, and mushrooms. It was delicious, chewy, and flavorful. 
The kimchee (cabbage, radish) were surprisingly fermented and spcied just right.
Rice cooked like any Korean mother would.. 
I could do without the macaroni too much mayo.. 

The second trip had the dol sot bi bim bap and it was not bad. It had all the usual suspects: radish, spinach, beef, egg...

I went here with two friends during a trip last month (July 2010), and we all loved it.  I ordered the Island Pig, which is like a pulled pork with cabbage.  One of us got the combo platter with chicken, short rib (I think?), and this egg coated beef (can't rememb the name).  Last person got the stone pot bibimbap.  All fantastic.

The owner was super friendly, and brought us four different kinds of kim chi/pickled vegetables - and refilled them when he brought out our food.   I liked all of them, but particularly liked the bean sprout salad and the cucumbers.  He also brought us gyoza before the food arrived and watermelon for desert.  All for $30.

The older people got hot drinks, and the younger people got the iced version. Not sure if that's a cultural thing... 

We ordered mandu (dumpling) soup, half champeong (spicy seafood noodle) and half jajungmeun (bean paste noodles), and pork + cabbage with rice. We got a few good standard side dishes, too. The main dishes were very flavorful (maybe too salty). The shredded pork was a bit dry, but I enjoyed it anyway. I thought it was awesome how you can do half of the champeong and half jajungmyun. Brilliant.

They gave you boiled peanuts in a styrofoam box if you ask for it. I think some tables just got it without asking... It's free... I'm not quite sure how the system works. The workers there speak Korean and the younger workers are bilingual.

It's in a schlocky strip mall which had me slightly skeptical upon arrival. Walking in the place was pretty warm and there were flies flying around. The owner said he would be right over and the natives stared @ us. As we waited a few minutes I started to worry that this was going to be a miss. (I understand Nathan Y's review) However, once the food started flying and the owner began razz-ma-tazzing with my party, we had a great time and meal.

~ Loved the boiled peanuts
~ Loved the veggie apps: bean sprouts, Napa cabbage and turnups, he brought us a second batch.
~ My teenage nephews (human garbage cans, or robotic eating machines, take your pick) were tapping uncle with the gut-bombs that were fried rice and 5 egg omelets.
~ My bro had the combo plate with the ribs, chicken & egg mixture. He said he would order it again.
~ I had the Teriyaki Pork. I had to ask what cut it was, I thought belly since it was thin and like bacon. It's pork loin cut really thin and marinated. It was one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. It has a sweet taste, it eats like candy. Really, really good & I don't care for sweet dishes by and large.

Great place, that is a hike, but worth the hike. Very cool owner working the front while his wife cooks in back. 5 stars for the food.

Condition: Don't let the location of a ghetto strip mall & exterior ""hole-in-the-wall"" appearance fool you. The restaurant is very clean and well-kept. Even the chopsticks are nicer than most restaurants in Vegas

Service: A+++ Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by Russell right away. Before i could even put my bag down he came by with free boiled peanuts, water and menu recommendations for us. Guess we looked like newbies :P Russell also made sure our water and tea glasses were never empty and kept refilling our side dishes without even being asked. He is definitely not stingy about his food like most Asian restaurants. We weren't treated as customers, but more like family

Food: A+++
         - I got the Seafood Soondubu + Kalbi + Fish = A+++ Tasty tofu soup with clams, mushroom & shrimp. The kalbi and fish were good, but nothing extraordinary. 
           - My BF and GF got the Combo with Meat Jun, chicken & Kalbi with substituted    fried rice. DELICIOUS! Not to mention, the portions were pretty big, which just means i get to share with them :P

Complimentary Side dishes: A+++ radish, cabbage kimchee, bean sprouts, & Hot dog with onions. My favorite was the cabbage kimchee --i could eat those like chips!!! The hot dog and bean sprouts were also yummy. Russell also brought us some dried seaweed and ""korean style"" kimchee to try out; that one was too sour for me.

I am definitely coming back the next chance i get! I love Russell's enthusiasm and charismatic personality! How he runs his restaurant is refreshing and rare in this town. My BF even said he felt like Russell was like an Uncle to him LOL

A note to foodie snobs... this place may look more like a hole in the wall rather than a gourmet restaurant, but don't dis the place because of its appearance - you're missing out on some awesome food!

Took my brother along for lunch after we ran a couple of errands. After an appetizer of fried mandoo and the usual banchan I had the combo plate (meat jun, kalbi and BBQ chicken) and he went with the roast beef and gravy plate lunch. Neither one of us left anything on the plate when we finished. Yes, its that good!

Russell, the owner is a very friendly person choke full of the 'aloha spirit' and it rubs off on the wait staff as well. We didn't have to wait very long for our meals - I'd say it was already piping hot and on our table in less than ten minutes.

We were greeted by Braddah Russell, who was so friendly.  He took our order and came back with little dishes of kim chee, radish kim chee, fish cake, peanuts, bean sprouts, hot dogs w/onions.

I ordered the combination plate, which came with ghalbi, meat jun and grilled chicken. The ghalbi was excellent and that's what earns it a four-star rating from me. Really good grilled flavor. The meat jun is like an omelet and it was nice too. The grilled chicken was petty much standard grilled chicken.
Island Style is a fusion Korean and Hawaiian restaurant and I guess that showed in my meal with the inclusion of macaroni salad with the meat and steamed rice. It was nice, too. There were only two banchan dishes, white radish kim chee and cabbage kim chee. But the dishes were quite large for banchan. The white radish kim chee was a stand out. It was a pretty good version. The kim chee at Island Style is not especially spicy but still good.
If I were to go back, I'd skip the combo and just order a plate of ghalbi. But it looks like there's other good things on the menu, too., nan",3.39,Steve,693,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

I went here for lunch and was immediately welcomed into the restaurant by the owner. My brother and I sat down and were served their famous boiled peanuts. Being from the South I am very familiar with boiled peanuts and these were some of the best I have had in years. Then he brought out some Kimchi and Bamboo shoots to snack on. Wow! So good. About the best kimchi I have ever had. Yum!

For our entrees we both had the meat jun and we were by no means disappointed. It was again probably the best meat jun I have ever had. Again Wow Yummy Amazing! 

The owner even brought us out some fried mandu to try, completely graits might I add. And yet again it was awesome!

Along with the awesome hospitality, everything we ordered was really really good. What we had was the teriyaki salmon and the fried rice, the son had the spam masubi. What we also tried was the this fried wonton gyoza type thing, I'm not sure what the name of it was, because he brought it out to us ""on the house"". They brought in some side dishes before our meal that was kimchi, sprouts, hotdogs, and some radish type thingy. I really want to describe all my food (but I will only reviews my teriyaki salmon) and everything I sampled from others that were with us, but the thing is, I'm not sure what their meal was, but what I can tell you is that everything I did try was really really good, with no complaints whatsover. 

Ok for our teriyaki salmon, it was probably the best salmon I've ever tasted at a restaurant, they made my food perfect. Don't you hate it when your fish turns out dry because it has been over cooked? well this salmon was a bit rawish in the middle, I guess you can say it was cooked ""rare"" I guess you can say in steak terms. I love raw fish (sushi type) and this meal reminded me just that, cooked on the outside, but slightly in the inside. Just typing about my meal is making me hungry again. It was nice and juice cooked to perfection with some yummy dipping sauce and mac salad and rice on the side. YUUUMMMMMMM

I will cut this review short because I will come back and re review this place. I really wanted to try the oxtail soup on the menu, but already thought we ordered way too much food. I'll be back for more soon.

Usually a good service place + really really good food = 5 stars, but I yet I only gave e'm 4.

Like everyone else has said, the owner is a hard working guy, and takes pride in his food....and I can taste it. 

I am grateful this place is thriving (they have been open for 20 yrs +) and I'm  fortunate that I've had to the opportunity to experience it.

I have never a bad dish here....the free starter dishes are amazing, and if you are new to this style of food I recommend the combo hands down.

utw9shTN4Yd6MnJ0QPgw4A,xxOQ7h6s3InV8o8DOVHlMA,2013-01-10,5.0,"I had a hard time deciding how to rate this not because of indifference on my part, but rather with respect to what to expect. So let's just start with, if you're looking for the full-on Korean experience with dozens of bowls around you and formal, even surly, sullen service, this is not the place. But if you want some excellent food in a relaxed environment, you won't be disappointed.

The name says it all: this is Korean (and Hawaiian and, coming up, Chinese/Korean) with island style. The owner (or the husband of the owner couple) just oozes chill; it's practically relaxing just talking to him. And he'll hang out and chat. Even call you ""brah."" The service overall is personal, informal, and pleasant.

This is a tiny place; it's in a strip mall, and you'd be forgiven for not finding it right away. You have to look hard and hope that you're not being pressed by busy Sahara traffic.

I was on my own, in town for CES. When seated, he first gave me a bowl of boiled peanuts to nosh on. Then came the banchan trio: kim chi, kaktugi (Korean radish kim chi), and bean sprouts. I'm reasonably familiar with kim chi (I make my own occasionally); this was good, although not particularly sour or complex. The kaktugi was great. He then brought out a separate bowl of this radish-green kim chi. This was absolutely excellent; spicy and sharp with a hint of sweet.

I went with the spicy squid; really good. (Not super spicy, but then again, I have a high threshold.)

Cost: around $15 for everything. Really. In contrast to many Korean places. And I left totally full.

Apparently they have just installed three high-intensity burners (they had just been inspected and approved that day), and they plan to do Chinese-style food too, like black noodles. They will also hand-make their own noodles.

Pity I don't live here; it would become a regular place for me. Clearly they have other regulars (one couple came in and the waiter asked if they wanted him to clean their regular table so they could sit there instead of somewhere new). Nice local indie place; that's where I like to spend my money when traveling, and I'll be back here at some point., nan",4.5,bryon,4,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

I have been here multiple times, and always have pleasant experiences. This time was no different.
The owner is beyond friendly! He and his wife genuinely care about the satisfaction of their guests. It is evident in their awesome service and attentiveness. He is always so eager to fill up our teas and side dishes, which are, by the way, super tasty! They are typical Korean sides, like pickled cucumbers, kimchi, bean sprouts, etc. I usually stuff myself so much with them, I end up full before my meal arrives lol.

Hubby & I love their bulgogi! It's so tender and flavorful. From what I remember, it is about $15. Expensive, but you're getting really big portions. You could share the meal with someone, especially since it comes with a giant pile of homemade macaroni salad (yum!). When it's cold outside, I like warming up with a hot bowl of soondubu. It's a Korean soup made with soft tofu, egg, and green onions. They add a seafood twist to it with shrimp and muscles. It's definitely a nice touch to the mildly spicy soup.

Overall, I always leave Island Style with a tummy full of delicious food that always comes with a side of great service. So make sure you bring your appetite when you come here!, nan",3.6,Courtney,10,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

When we got there the restaurant had a good amount of people.  There were only a couple of tables open.  We ended up getting our food to-go.  While we were waiting to put our order in, we sat down at one of the tables since the whole place is tightly packed in with the maximum amount of tables they can stuff in the space without breaking fire code.  A server came up to us and asked us what we would like.  I ordered the Meat Jun, hubs ordered the chicken katsu and our 11 year ordered kalua pork and cabbage.  The server asked us also if we wanted a drink and hubs and daugher ordered Hawaiian Suns.  He even walked my daugher to the cooler to show her what they had so she can pick what she wanted.  I had Korean iced tea which I LOVE.  A couple more parties came in and ordered and all got their food before us.  I don't know if it's because we weren't Korean or because they were Korean or if it's because our food was harder to prepare?  Then, another server came up to us surprised like she didn't notice us the first 4-5 times she walked by us and gave us menus again.  We told her that we already ordered.  I thought that was funny.  

We finally get our order after about 20-25 minutes which normally I would mind, but we had really no place to be.  The orders were correct and everything was really good.  It was my first time trying meat jun and I think I will always order that there.  Hubs liked his chicken katsu and daughter liked her kalua pork.  She didn't finish it all, but she's a tiny 11-year-old.  

I will be back, but I might take my Korean friends next time to see how much faster our orders go through.  Lol., nan",4.17,Kristine,59,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

We had the BBQ combo and the Pork Katsu.  I was looking for the Hawaiian aspect, but ended up with a Korean aberation of Hawaiian food.  The katsu sauce was more like a ketchup sauce or a shrimp cocktail sauce.  The pork katsu was over cooked and dry.  I suspect the cutlet was under a heat lamp i.e. precooked like a mickey dees.   The Kalbi and BBQ chicken were good.  The meat jun is coated with egg and like the cutlet, I seemed like it was a heat lamp item too.  It didn't have that freshly made taste.

I rarely give 5 stars. But this place definitely deserves it. Why?
Here are some reasons:
1. Impeccable geniune service from the owner Russel who is a hawaiian native (big island) whose wife is korean. 
2. Its a hole in the wall place, but neat and clean. A place where you feel safe to eat. But don't be fooled by the surrounding stores in the unassuming strip mall.
3. Price is right for good hawaiian and good korean food in Vegas. 
4. Big servings! FRIED RICE IS GREAT! Spam, eggs, and all the rest of the typical fried rice ingredients. 
5. Mandu - fried gyoza/dumpling type stuff which is extra crispy skin on the outsdie and delicious pork,cabbage stuffing. 
6. They have kimchee that is homemade! =) 

All the best homestyle hawaiian food and korean favorites (bulgolgi, spam, bi bam bop in a claypot)

The best part of our experience is the owner and his generosity. He's the surfer type, hawaiian, laid back - he's your uncle kind of guy that treats like your his old friend. Offered us complimentary katsu with our meal and brought out extra soup for our table of 4. Most generous guy. 

They have another place located downtown near the korean stores, we must check it out next time we're in town.

My first visit was on a Friday afternoon. I ordered take out. Since it was still Lent I opted for the fish jun (egg battered fish fillet-served with a soy vinegar sauce). While I was waiting for my food I got to chat it up with Russel. He was extremely friendly. By the time my food was ready I felt like I was talking to my uncle. My second visit I ordered the Meat Jun. Not as good as Hawaii meat jun but since I live in Las Vegas this is as close as it gets. 

Extra stars for the fact that he remembered on my second visit that I like a side of siracha hot sauce. More stars for the fact that when I opened up my take out bag there was a surprise: boiled peanuts! Too bad Yelp will only allow me to rate up to 5 stars. 

The restaurant is located in a strip mall and you can easily miss it. But if you do have the opportunity stop by. You won't be disappointed., nan",3.55,Michelle,46,"['Korean', 'Asian Fusion', 'Hawaiian', 'Restaurants']",Island Style,"3909 W Sahara Ave

From the first bite, I was in love. There's this burst of flavor that reminds me of food I've had in Hawaii (go figure). I know something is good when I can't stop thinking about how good it was and when I can get back. Thank goodness I live close by  so Island Style will be one of my new hot spots.

Took ten years to find an acceptable place where all services are done well and professionally. 

Hue does my nails every two weeks and takes time to do every aspect right. Like an artist she carefully makes each nail perfect. No rushing or cutting corners.

Mai does my pedi. She knows I am a big hiker and need my nails short. I started having pedis because I had beat my toes up hiking and she worked with my feet for over a year while the 7 nails I had lost came back. It was a mess but I know they came back flat and straight because of her diligence. 

It has become tradition for my sis and I to come every Christmas for a mani pedi together for the great work and the fun we have with the technicians. 

I read below that a customer was mad because he couldn't pay over the phone. Reading his story, it sounded more to me like their policy protected him from identity theft and though there was a miscommunication, The salon would have already known that he hadn't paid when she arrived but they provided the service without even balking and then trusted payment in the future. That is not bad customer service it is excellent service. Especially in Vegas where scams are the norm!

In the state I had previously lived in, I tried several salons before I finally found a stylist that could color my hair the way I liked. She worked at an Aveda Salon.  Being new to this state, I figured that I would be trying several stylists again before finding one that I liked.  I decided I would start with another Aveda Salon, and contacted this salon because of it's location.  
I explained to the receptionist my concerns about trusting someone to color my hair.  He scheduled me with Tarah.  I called back again two days later asking him if he was sure that this 'Tarah' had enough experience and again expressing my nervousness about getting my hair colored by someone new.  He reassured me that Tarah was very good and had been with the salon for at least three years.
Today was my appointment and I am very happy with my color and cut.  The highlights and color look more natural and radiant than ever!  I am almost embarrassed to admit that I was so worried about getting a stylist that wasn't as good, that it didn't even occur to me that she might be better.  Just watching Tarah as she worked with my hair, I knew that I had moved up with salon professionals.  She definitely knew what she was doing.  In addition, she made suggestions to which Aveda Products would work better with my hair in this climate. 
She also did an eyebrow wax and that looks great also.

My hair came out really nice, the highlights weren't exactly the color I was going for, but that's just me being stubborn and looking at a picture automatically expecting it to look like that.

But I decided to go because I really like Avada salons. I try to only go to them because their salons are normally a little higher end and I like the extras they include. On paper these things make them stand out as a brand to me and thats why I choose them. I would say the front desk customer service is about a 4 out of 10. The guy was just not overly welcoming or enthusiastic about his job at all. It kinda lead to a few awkward silent moments of standing around for me while I was waiting for my stylist. I ended up loving my haircut. My stylist was really nice and my color turned out amazing. I spent $150 for a cut and color, with the cut I got I feel like I got a really good deal! However, I have decided not to return for a few reasons.

Things I liked,

-My hairstylist although I can't remember her name (she didn't have business cards and I am terrible with names) I felt like I got a very high quality cut and color. 

-The quality products. I try to only go to Avada salons. I like their products and I always feel like I come out of with beautiful hair.

-No problems with parking

-I felt like I paid a reasonable prices for the value I got

Things that prevent me from going back,

-I didn't feel that the spa like relaxed feeling like I normally do at other Avada salons. Just a little too blah for my taste. With multiple Avada salons in town I believe I will be able to find one that is more what I am looking for.

Dust, I saw more dust than I wanted to see. I wouldn't quite call it dirty because that is a big leap. But dusty, yes.

-Tipping is not allowed on Cards. For myself it was a choice of no tip or a tip on a credit card based off of what I had in my wallet. I am a former massage therapist I love cash tips too but sometimes you just take what you get. Im not meaning that in a negative way at all but Im a strong believer in if someone wants to tip, they should be able to do it however they please. When I asked about this policy the man at the front told me it was so the hairstylist don't have to pay taxes on it. Currently working in accounting I was turned off by this. However, after I explained that i didn't have any cash on me I was told I could tip on a credit card. I am just not a fan of making the client feel like an inconvenience.

-Front Desk Customer Service, I feel like there was a serious lack of customer service. Just because you offer someone water when they walk in doesn't automatically equal great customer service. 

Overall my visit wasn't bad and it wasn't good at the same time. Therefore I believe 3 stars represents my experience well., nan",2.4,Roe,6,"['Hair Salons', 'Waxing', 'Nail Salons', 'Hair Removal', 'Beauty & Spas']",Creative Salon and Spa: Aveda,"7625 S Rainbow Blvd

I found a coupon on their website for a free cut with any color- not a bad deal, plus all the good reviews here on yelp made my decision easy. Because it was my first time, and I didn't have a recommended stylist to go with, I asked for a Saturday appointment with whoever was available. My stylist was Ericka, and thank goodness! She was great! I was cutting about 6 inches off my hair and had a picture of what I was envisioning with me. Ericka and I talked about what we could do, the different types of tints/dyes/hues that would work best to achieve my desired color. And we had a long conversation about how the cut would work- I have extremely fine, wavy-but-not-curly hair, and the wrong cut can be horrendous on me. I'm really glad she listened to what I wanted, and gave her feedback to honestly tell me what would work. The salon experience was great- Ericka is easy to talk to, everything was clean, and the salon smells wonderul with all the Aveda products being used. I was super happy with my cut and color, and Ericka and the salon owner were so kind at check-out.

Well, 3 other bridesmaids and I were supposed to get out hair done for my brother's wedding, which is a really big deal!! We came from Los Angeles and had our day perfectly planned with hair then makeup then the hotel for the ceremony.
My new sister in law made us appointments and was quoted $65 flat! When we arrived they said the cost would be $95 for my hair length! Then a hairstylist (which sounded like a Russian Accent) came to us with this snotty attitude, talking down to us and tried to imply as if we couldn't afford it which definitely has not the fact!!! We for quoted a price and we wanted the price which we were quoted! The male receptionist then said ""oh that's just the price we say over the phone"" so basically lie!!! 
So, while getting my makeup done at MAC , I told the artist the story and how sad I was that I won't have my hair done for my brothers wedding, he then recommended me to try LOOK Salon at the Town square which we enjoyed so much and the prices were great!

I having been going in to get quick trims, and I usually like to be there at 9 in the morning. At that time, there are rarely other patrons around. I usually get Nena, as she probably is the first to arrive there, along with the owner (who sticks to nails, I think). Nena is very nice, not too talkative and very assertive. She is one of the few people who gets how to trim bangs for 20-somethings, without making them look lame or like ""emos"". The price for these types of trims is about $15, and the service will take about 15 minutes. 

I have also gone in for pedicures, and have been satisfied though you could probably get the same service elsewhere (is there any stripmall in Vegas without a nail salon?) for about 5 dollars less. 

One of the worst things here is the fact that they recently decided to not accept tips with your credit card bill. This means that you have to bring cash in, or you will have to forgo leaving a tip, which I consider quiet rude. I do not really know why they did this, though I'm thinking it has to do with cutting back on expenses (i.e., paying bank fees). Whatever the reason, I think this policy makes the client uncomfortable, and she or he will likely leave the salon feeling akward. However, since they implemented this policy, I have gone in about four times, and I have never had cash with me. They go ahead and run my card, and the bill includes a ""tip ____"", which I have proceeded to add, despite the annoyed look I get from the receptionist, as well as the ""this is the last time miss, we are no  longer accepting tips like this"" statement. 

So, bring cash to tip your stylist, and if you can, choose either Nena or Mai, they are both nice and good at what they do., nan",3.97,martha,65,"['Hair Salons', 'Waxing', 'Nail Salons', 'Hair Removal', 'Beauty & Spas']",Creative Salon and Spa: Aveda,"7625 S Rainbow Blvd

Prior to my hair cut,she shampooed/conditioned it, then she massaged my scalp with a special oil that gave it a nice tingly feeling. Ohhh! The head massage felt good! I'm sure it was a special Aveda oil since they are an Aveda salon. They all about that Aveda life! I love how she was not too gentle & not too rough when shampooing & massaging my scalp. Sometimes, I go to places & they seem so forceful, but not Hue. She was perfect.

 As she was doing my hair, I felt like she was very professional & had great experience. I thought she was very lovely & takes pride in what she does. You can tell when people are happy doing what they're doing because it shows in their work. She told me she takes classes every month to keep up w/ the new trends & ideas. Hue was the sweetest & the best hairdresser. I loved my fresh new hair cut.

The next time, I came in with an appointment, She gave me some color & highlights, checked to see if I had any more split ends so she can handle that sheeeit & did my nails. I was like, ""Dang, you do everything around here!""
They do hair, nails, pedi, lash extensions, etc. w/ outstanding service, offering that hot tea or water every time you come in. Ooh la la. I was pretty pleased w/ the results. When I went to work the next day, people were giving me compliments which doesn't happen often but when it does I'm like, ""oh thank you!' (blush, blush).

 I ran out of time because I was there for about 2 hrs so I made an appointment to go back the next day for a pedicure.

Her husband, Michael helped me the next day for a pedicure. He was fast friendly & did a great job.  I'm always wearing those high heels for my job so my feet are calloused sometimes, but he got rid of them pretty good. Put some fresh paint on the toenails & it was good to go.

So after coming here 3 times w/ such a wonderful experience each time, I figure I would show some yelp love to this salon. Even though, I don't take advantage of their refreshment offerings, I think it's so thoughtful of them to offer. They're so sweet! This salon is probably my new favorite., nan",4.33,Roxanne,62,"['Hair Salons', 'Waxing', 'Nail Salons', 'Hair Removal', 'Beauty & Spas']",Creative Salon and Spa: Aveda,"7625 S Rainbow Blvd

TSJXfpl83qKSLvjlx7Otlg,DoV1-l-CFr6Ig7SdKUDY2Q,2013-05-30,2.0,"Please note this review is for the salon NOT the stylists. 

From the salon perspective I have had multiple poor customer service experiences, below I will list the two most prominent. 

I have been going to this salon for a little over a year and have only amazing things to say about every stylist I have encountered. As such I have recommended most my family and coworkers to go here. That being said; the customer service from a receptionist perspective has been fairly poor all around. There are particularly 2 incidents which led to this review and the 3rd being that they discourage leaving a tip for the stylist on a card and actually ask you to bring cash (seems fishy and in bad taste).

1. I had made an appointment on a day in which I was flying out of town for work and was on a tight schedule. I arrived a few min early but basically right on time. The receptionist (i don't recall her name) just looked back and said ""oh your stylist is out, she should be back shortly"". I then sat in the lobby for 15 min waiting when my stylist walked out from the back and greeted me and said she had been waiting but no one told her I was there. This was true because the receptionist didn't even leave the seat to check.

2. For my mother birthday / mothers day I wanted to treat her to a spa day. I called ahead and asked if I could purchase a gift certificate online or over the phone so that she could come in and get her hair done. When speaking with the receptionist I was told that I couldn't purchase it online so she would make a not on the account and they would call me for payment when she completed. Giving my mother this info she didn't take any payment with her when she went to get her hair done, assuming that is was taken care of. After the cut was complete she was left embarrassed now that she couldn't pay at the time. I spoke to the salon manager and explained the scenario who told me ""oh well they gave you wrong info she needs to pay"". After a short discussion I assured them she would be back. Needless to say this turned in to multiple trips to the salon plus the embarrassment she faced. 

Not only did this second scenario ruin what was to be a nice thing it he even asked her to leave collateral. It was quite offensive and IMO in poor judgment given there mistake. 

All in all. Stylists are great - owners / managers / receptionists - thumbs down., nan",3.38,Zak,8,"['Hair Salons', 'Waxing', 'Nail Salons', 'Hair Removal', 'Beauty & Spas']",Creative Salon and Spa: Aveda,"7625 S Rainbow Blvd

TzIKDnA0oxju2lwBExELKw,DoV1-l-CFr6Ig7SdKUDY2Q,2012-12-11,5.0,"Completely Ecstatic!  First, I am sad to admit it, but I never write reviews for anything.  But, find a stylist who not only knows what they are doing but is better than expected is worthy of the compliment.  I have been going to the same stylist for over 8 years in Newport Beach CA, he is incredible but having moved to Las Vegas two months ago, it's a little to far for my regular monthly cut.  So I had the daunting task of finding someone I trust to 'do my do' which is a serious matter and I put a lot of research, thought and effort into making my choice.  
1. The salon had to have an esthetic appeal (none of that icky strip mall junk) 
2. I wanted more than just a quick cut and no pampering
3. Of course, the stylist needed to listen and get what I was wanting to achieve.  

Well, I was pleasantly surprised because the salon looks great and has a clean upbeat vibe.  It reminds me of a salon that might be in a hotel/casino.  And best of all, my stylist Tarah (YOU ROCK) not only listened to what I was asking her to do, but she asked questions as she cut my hair such as how much length in certain areas I wanted cut; did I want more texture etc.  Amazing!  And the end result was actually better than my hair had been cut in a while.  She has definitely earned me as a regular client.  I can't tell you how relieved I am to know I have someone I can trust to do the job when I need it especially being new to town!

I would recommend going to Creative and ask for Tarah.  You will be glad you did.

I did a walk in @ 9am. I requested for Tara to do my hair so I did a last minute appointment @ 11am. The receptionist told me that you can come back 15 min early since Tara comes in early before her start time. I came in 5 min before 11. I waited half an hour for Tara but still she wasn't there so I requested for someone else to do my hair. I ask the receptionist if someone can do this ombré style and I showed a picture and he recommended me to Julia. They said ""Julia is the best."" I showed Julia the picture and she said yes I can do that. (Note: if you can't do exactly what I ask for, then don't tell me you can.) So I was excited... Hours later.. the end results? My hair is damaged and dry. And my ombré didn't even look ombré. It was a blunt line color going around my head and she didn't mix the product in all the way so everything was different color. I ask her to fix my bangs also and she made it even shorter!!! It looked like Spock from Star Trek. I was devastated. I literally started crying. The lady who is the owner said well next time you should make an appointment. So???? It gives you the right to mess up my hair and be okay with it because I didn't make an appointment with Julia??? Are you kidding me??? I'm paying for the service!! My hair was long and very healthy. I paid $200 + for them to mess up my long, healthy hair. The owner Michael also said he can have someone fix my hair when I called for them to fix it. When I asked if i would pay again he said don't worry about it, I just want you to be happy. So when I went again to fix my hair I had to pay again! This will be the last time I will ever step foot inside this salon. But I do want to thank ONLY ONE PERSON and that's coco for fixing my messed up ombré hair. The wife of Michael who is the owner said it could've be done for free if Julia did it but she told me AFTER THE FACT that someone else did it. I was very traumatized on what julia did the first time!!! You think I want her to fix my hair again after she messed it up? For days I did leave in conditioner and did so many treatments on my hair but regardless my hair was nappy I was unable to comb it. It was horrible!!! I had to cut at least five inches off my hair cause it was damaged. This may have a lot of good reviews but I won't ever recommend this salon to anyone that I know.

For the reply below... It wasn't a ""lack of communication"" on my end. I specifically told her what I wanted. How I wanted it. And I went a second time to fix it. To give it another chance... But you can't give me back the five inches I had to cut off. So I do apologize for writing a bad review because I had to cut five inches off my hair and pay $200+ for the style I didn't want. Thank you very much., WAY OVER PRICED!!! You don't get what you pay for. You're not paying for the service or the hairstylist. You're actually paying for the ""products"". If the people in this salon mess up your hair the first time. You have to have the same person fix it the second time. In order for it to be free at no charge. But it still won't be free because you still have to pay for the ""products"" that's going to be used, to fix your hair!",3.31,Shayne,40,"['Hair Salons', 'Waxing', 'Nail Salons', 'Hair Removal', 'Beauty & Spas']",Creative Salon and Spa: Aveda,"7625 S Rainbow Blvd

Came here before heading out to the airport since it was right in the hotel we were at (Harrah's). It's located right near the exit of where the Mickey Ds/Panda Express/Chipotle is. It was breakfast time on the border of lunch when we arrived and it was about $19. I think they have a deal where you can get unlimited alcoholic drinks? The customer service from the cashier and our waitress was excellent. 

On to the food, it was pretty decent. From the looks of it, I thought it was going to be bad but I enjoyed most of the food I ate.  The hash browns were nice and buttery, which I got thirds of. The other selections were small but I liked it better than Cravings at Mirage...I think anywhere is better than there. For $19, not worth it. Maybe $10?? I'd come back to try the dinner because it sounds like they have some good options.

With that as a starter, went the BBQ route by adding BBQ baked beans, mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese and some smoked kielbasa sausage. Overall it was ok. Good but not mmmmmm!  Next, I had a few bites of my wife's clam chowder. I was surprised at the chunks and tenderness if the clams! Very pleased with this particular flavor of New England clam chowder which enticed me to try a seafood plate. As I approach the seafood area I changed my mind. Cocktail shrimp I have to peel?!? C'mon man! No thanks. The fried cod wasn't looking to appetizing either, so I moved on to another ""flavors"" section. Tried a variety plate including fried chicken, cause you can't mess up fried chicken. Tasted like KFC. Added some orange chicken wings and some ""crab"" rangoon. Well the ""crab"" rangoons were veggie. They tasted like egg rolls except they were shaped like rangoons. Not very tasty and misleading? C'mon man! The chicken wings were to crispy to eat. I managed to tear off a piece and chew it for 5 minutes until deciding it wasn't worth it. Ok so no more ""food"", onto desserts. My choices were: mini strawberry cheese cake which was VERY rich! I ate half of it. Boston Cream Pie cupcake, gone in one bite. Coconut Cream Pie cupcake, gone in one bite. Chocolate crunch bar, gone in two bites. Bread pudding was pretty good with vanilla sauce drizzled in top. Some type of apple streusel with a sweet sugary sauce also was tasty. The dessert certainly bumped it up a whole star. The service was 4 stars. Our waitress always made sure our drinks were full though. Even tried to get my wife to get another glass of wine! My first two beers were just a little cooler than room temp, they fixed that with the next two icy cold Coors Lights. Overall experience was subpar to average at best. Flavors might consider changing their name to Blands.

So let's talk about the food instead. Mmm Mm! 

Round One: Started with a salad. Just about eveything you could think of wanting on a American-style buffet salad, kinda wished there were kidney beans but the Ranch dressing made up for it. Ranch the way restaurant Ranch is supposed to be. Creamy without being thick, flavorful and heavy on the dairy.

Round Two: Fried Raviolis - Not what I wanted them to be. The fried outside overwhelmed the stuffing and I could only eat two before I was bored. Hush Puppies - tasted like your mama's. Roasted Red Potatoes - crispy but soft to bite into, spiced nicely and not too salty. Steamed Veggies - tasted like the vegetables they are. Stuffed Shell in Seafood Sauce. The Stuffed Shell... OH MY GOD. So delicious! I wished I'd gotten just a solid plate of them!

Round Three: Two more Stuffed Shells. I told you they were good!! Stuffed with Ricotta, Egg and spices, topped with some kind of white sauce with just a hint of seafood, not some overpowering fishy taste, then fresh, chopped tomatoes on top. So yummy but soooo filling. What? No room for desert?

Ok, Round Four: A slightly painful Chocolate Covered Rice Krispie Treat. Only painful because I was so full!! There's a chocolate fountain at the end of the buffet and an assortment of snacks to dip in it. The chocolate is flavorful, not that bland, stale taste that sometimes happens to chocolate fountains.

Ok, the things I personally missed: Crab Legs - Everybody loved these. My girls at the end of the table split three plates worth. Shrimp Cocktails - Two of my party went back for Shrimp Cocktail seconds when I went back for my Stuffed Shells. Gourmet Desserts - There's a whole section of them with Pastry Chefs hanging about to answer questions and take personal orders.

In most buffets you could hit every section of food a couple of times but this one was so big that you really had to just narrow down to choosing a couple. One of which MUST be the dessert area. Omg...tiny little carrot cakes, apple crumbles, frozen yogurt, chocolate brownies....I really wish I could have taken a doggie bag home. 

Service was great too. Be warned though--they close at 10 and stop putting fresh food out at 10:30 so if you want ample time to eat get there earlier. They were really nice and accommodating to our big group and let us in right before 10. (Hey, Vegas--why does everything CLOSE before you've even had lunch?!)

Flavors buffet at Harrahs Casino for breakfast was excellent.  The line wasn't too long and it was reasonably priced for a buffet in Las Vegas.  

There were just a few things to understand for this level of buffet.   

1. It's a buffet.  Everything is cooked institutionally. 
2. You can find better buffets if y you want to spend exorbitant amounts of money.
3. There are just some things that should never be institutionally cooked. .. like eggs benedict.

Other than that, here are a few things that Mabee this buffet great.

1. They had miniature Belgium waffles with a variety of toppings, yum.
2. Egg station where they cook omelets and eggs any style to order.
3. Grits, oatmeal, and cream of wheat.
4. Good chicken fried steak and country gravy.
5. The parfaits, cupcakes,  and desserts were amazing.
6. Roast new york cut beef and kielbasa.
7. The servers were awesome.   They were eager to please and very attentive. 

One of the most important things to do is to get a great deal.   $18.99 per person is a little high for breakfast.  If alone, get a player's club card, play a little and use your comps to offset the cost.  If you don't play, then get a card anyway and get the $1 discount.  If party of 2 then get groupon and $28.99 for 2 includes all you can drink mimosas or bloody marys.  

There is a little confusion about Groupon calling this a half price deal.   The deal is with the alcohol.   It would normally be $18.99 plus $10.00 for the alcohol add-on.

Even if you don't drink,  it's still a good deal.  You save $9.

Overall, for the money, it's a great buffet, and perfect for those morning afters that Las Vegas is so famous for.  YMMV!  ENJOY!!, nan",4.0,Doug,14,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

To start off, we literally waited almost 45 minutes in line to even get into the buffet.  And, this was a Monday night and it wasn't all that busy.  One thing that really pissed us off was that we were 3rd or 4th in line, but they have this Express Line.  If you pay an additional $5 per person, you get to go into the Express Line ahead of everyone else.  It was quite infuriating to see people walk in and get seated ahead of you when you've been waiting 45 minutes to be seated.

Crab legs?  Yea, they have them.  In fact, that's why we went.  But, they were either under cooked or way overcooked and you could hardly get any meat out of them.  They were definitely not worth the wait or the price!

The best things were the spaghetti with alfredo sauce and the big selection of desserts.  The carved ham wasn't too bad either.  The prime rib was cold and extremely fatty.

I'm thankful that we had a buy one, get one free coupon because it was worth MAYBE $10 instead of the normal $19.99.

This is probably the first breakfast buffet I've had aside from those that are complimentary at some hotels, and I was very happy with it. It offers plenty of choices - your standard American fare, some Mexican and Chinese stuff (though the latter seemed like left overs from the night before) and plenty of sweets.   That's what I went for, and I was quiet happy.

The mini lemon cheesecakes, raspberry pudding cups, cheese blitz and apple crepes were all excellent  - you'd be happy if you got them at a 5-star restaurant.  Also nice were the bread pudding with vanilla sauce, the cinnamon roll and the brownie.  Less successful was the custard (not sweet enough), the croissants (a bit dry) and the bacon (good flavor but dried out).  The sausages, on the other hand, were great.  Skip the heavy, cakey doughnuts and the chewy bagels, though there is lox if you want them.  The pancakes and French toast could have been better, I wouldn't bother with them.  The biscuits were good, but look for the ones in the warm tray.

Don't skip the fruit, while the strawberries were tasteless, the watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew melon were perfectly ripe and sweet - they were a hit with my husband and kids.  The pineapple was the canned type, but my youngest enjoyed it.

There is also a carving station (ham, I think) and make-to-order omelets, which we didn't try.  You can order ice cream as well - I wasn't too fond of the strawberry one.

As for drinks, the coffee was fine, the hot cocoa standard, I felt the chocolate milk was weak but my daughter liked it.

The minus part of the buffet is that we got it as part of the ""Buffet of buffets"" deal, but we were so full after eating it that we couldn't take advantage of the lunch buffet that was included in the price., nan",3.65,Margarita,93,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

I started my marathon buffet of buffets with a champagne brunch here and was disappointed that champagne was extra (it isn't at the Flamingo's buffet) but was OK with $6 for unlimited refills...  and unlimited refills I had!  Seven glasses later I think they probably could have served me soggy Wheaties and I would have been OK with it.

The brunch fare was standard, but I was impressed with their having gelato and also a bagel and lox station.

Ordered hot tea expecting green tea. It was Lipton black tea.  Best thing I had was the won ton soup.  

Tried to find the restroom. Asked a waitress and she said it was outside in the casino. Why the heck do they do that? She told me to go out, take a left, pass the piano and I'd see it. Umm yeah... I never found it,  nor a piano. I wandered around a bit then came back and held it in until we were done eating. 

At the entrance the staff were not friendly but not mean. Just kinda doing their job without a care for our convenience. 

The meal times are crazy...  Breakfast is from 7am-11am, dinner is 11am-10pm. Dinner is twice as much as breakfast, and there is no lunch period. Gotta love Vegas.

This is the best one for taking kids or a lot of people.

They have an omelette station, big desert bar & many types of cuisine (Mexican, Italian, Japanese, Asian, Salads, French, Brazilian, Pastries, Seafood).

6YIDcz5adapxOsZURfTgOA,0_LZEAYsexEZS-OFTjdjNQ,2013-09-24,4.0,"I like Harrah's Buffet for two reasons.  First and foremost, this is one of the best dessert buffets around.  Not only do they have ice cream and all the toppings (Including hot toppings!), but they also have a great selection of mini cupcakes (let me recommend the lemon... yum!) AND cotton candy to go!  So, if you just want to get your dessert on, I would check this out.  They have huge slices of pies and cookies and other little bites, but a really nice selection of GOOD stuff.  Although, they have swapped out doing Creme Brulee for a flan style custard.  Dummy heads.

The second reason is while they don't have 500 tastes, the ones they do have are pretty darn good.  The prime Rib was PERFECT.  They have containers for your condiments.  The service is good and it felt like an overall value.

We were doing the Buffet of Buffets so I didn't look at what the price was when we went for lunch, but I'm sure it was over $20.  The only negative was they made you take a picture before you went in and hand you this giant fork and spoon, which kind of grossed me out since I had just washed up in preparation for eating!  When did taking your picture before entering a buffet become a thing???  No thanks.

Tries to do too much and all of it poorly.  Ok, maybe the cotton candy was alright.
Awful awful sushi.  I didn't even try the stir fry it looked so bad. Bland BBQ.  Salad bar scary, small and boring, and dressings not labeled/arranged.  Taco bar but no taco shells or tortillas.  I HATE snow crab legs that have been shredded in half, so much harder to extract the meat (if you think its a benefit then you don't know how to eat snow crab).  Burnt cream looked to have have the torch waved over it for a second leaving a film of sugar-water on top.
Ice cream and Carving station ok, swift attentive waiters.
I remember the days, not long ago, when $5.99 (or less) on the strip would get you about the same quality.  Then Mirage came in with 'gourmet' buffet and marked the beginning of massive price increases with the rationale that they were laying out high quality stuff.

Plenty of variety, including all the regular breakfast food staples. Everything tastes fresh and they have an omelet station where you can order your very own special omelet just the way you like 'em. 

I recently came for dinner with my husband for the first time. I didn't think the dinner buffet was at the same level as breakfast. Though the same amount of foods and cuisines were still available, not much appealed to me. Of the things I tried, most were just average. I didn't go back for seconds on anything. That was really okay with me because what they were lacking in regular food, they more than made up for in the dessert section, so I was able to fill up on tons of sweets. Flavors offers more desserts than some of the larger and more high end buffets, and they are still quality sugary goodness. Tons of ice cream and sherbet to choose from, cupcakes, pies, pastries, bread pudding, creme brûlée... you name it, they've got it. They even have a cotton candy machine where you can grab your own little stick of spun sugar!

One thing I noticed when browsing both regular food items and desserts is that the labeling was off. Maybe it was just on this particular evening, because I don't remember this being an issue during breakfast in the past, but many foods were not labeled at all and several were mislabeled as the wrong item. Others must have noticed this as well because I overheard another man tell his wife ""Hey! That's not hot fudge sauce! That's apple pie!"" Ahhh... Smart man right there. Good eye; good eye. 

I would be willing to give Flavors another shot for breakfast, but definitely not for lunch or dinner.

My husband I ate breakfast here twice and both times the refills never came. We watched our waitress talking to another table about fashion. I stopped a different waitress and she said I had to wait for our waitress. okay. 

Finally, she came back for refills about the time we were leaving. I don't think I'd go back here just based on the slow refills, call me picky, but those buffets are not cheap. If you don't opt in for the wrist band, which pays for itself in basically two meals, then show your Harrah's card and get a discount.

This buffet has a variety of types of food stations from seafood to pasta to American grill sort of stuff, etc. But seriously, everything was mediocre at best. The ONLY things I actually enjoyed were the crab stuffed tilapia, the quesadilla, and the little cheesecake cup. The rest of the food I picked at, and I tried nearly everything. 

Now I probably would've given them a 3 star rating as befits mediocrity, but added to the lame food was the fact that we waited in line for an hour despite the fact that we could see that an entire side of the restaurant was empty. Perhaps that was a staffing issue, but it still seems like bull.

I'm not a picky eater, just look at my previous reviews lol. I grew up poor so I know the struggle, and I wasn't looking for fine dining at $27. This place still disappointed me, though.

I was excited for the crab legs, but couldn't even eat them. They were too salty. Like a previous reviewer said, it's like they were soaked in salt water. On the other hand, the mussels were ""marinated"" but they were so bland! I'm a seafood lover, so this was upsetting for me that their seafood was not up to par. 

Eating in Thailand, a third world country, was more delicious (not saying that the food in Thailand is supposed to be gross or anything, but cmon). 

The rest of selection was okay, if a bit small. The Mac and cheese was creamy, the spaghetti was very flavorful, probably the most flavorful I've had! The tortillas were a little hard (not the hard shell ones but the ones that were supposed to be soft) so it seemed like they were left there for awhile. They only had chicken fajitas to fill them with also, which disappointed me. I love carne asada tacos haha.

The desserts were average. The ice cream was yummy and they had gelato as well. The chocolate mouse and mint mousse in the cups were plain, even according to my brother. The chocolate ecstasy was very delicious though if you're a chocolate lover. 

Overall, it wasn't anything special really. I would give it 1.5 stars.

The service, like stated by previous reviewers is the reason why I gave the extra star. They were attentive and very friendly, though there was an elderly woman worker complaining about being tired within earshot. I know it was close to closing time, but you shouldn't act like that in front of customers. This is coming from a past manager in retail. Presence and attitude is key to a happy experience on the guest's behalf. That was the only person who wasn't very good with service.

other dishes i liked were the 3-bean salad, cornbread dressing(like a stuffing), mashed potatoes, meatball.  the sushi was americanized and a skip for me.  didn't try the shumai or pork bun in the hot steamed area.  i planned on trying the carnitas, beans, etc to make myself a soft taco but they didn't have tortillas at the time.  when i got around to it, there was no room left since i still had dessert left.

Score! (We ate for about $16 a piece)

The good: 
-Prime rib, really not that bad for a 3rd tier buffet. Not overcooked like Rio.
-Nice sized snow crab legs, but ya gotta work to get em open as they aren't halved.
-Shrimp Cocktail, gotta shell em but they were fresh.
-Champagne included
-Hot fudge sundae for dessert...amazing how many buffets in Vegas don't have simple hot fudge to go with their ice cream or ""gelato"". It's usually chocolate syrup...here the fudge is hot!
-Kind and friendly staff
-They have a guy coming around with some hot specialty items...like right to your table...haven't seen that before...had some hot chicken skewers and some coconut tapioca thing...wasn't bad.

The bad:
Where are the correct food cards and how come they aren't placed in the right spot? The whole entire buffet had either no names to their dishes or incorrect names. Pancakes were Spanish rice, this whole other area with a pastry puff with ""something"" inside was a complete unknown and none of their desserts had any titles anywhere...is this the sugar free section? What is this? I hate sugar free, but who knows...and if you have a name card that says pancakes and it's 9pm, it means that no one bothered to make the food card change at all for the entirety of lunch and all the way to the end of dinner. Hash browns all day or is that ravioli?

I saw this buffet on a few top ten lists, all of which praised it for being far more affordable than the other top-notch Vegas buffets.  
My experience was laughably bad.
First, it's only $10 cheaper than some of the best buffets in Vegas (Bellagio may be my fave) at $27, and the experience is night and day.
Much of the food was mislabeled or had no name cards at all, and when I'd mention that fact to the cooks behind the counter, they literally shrugged.  I asked to move to a table near an outlet so I could charge my phone, and the waiter told me ""no one will help you there"", so I sat 15 feet from where they sat me... He walked past me 10 times and never got me a drink or said another word to me.
The food was just OK. Not as big a selection as the Rio or Wynn, and while I'm not big on shellfish and sea food, I'd say that was the strength of this buffet. The dessert selection was huge, but much lower-quality than any of the top-notch buffets.

Food: 
1. Primed ribs: wow super rare... I didn't bother touching it

2. No wine or champaign means no mimosa :( so I just got cranberry juice

3. A lot of Cajun food , which I love. Delicious sausages, chicken, veggies, and mashed potatoes. Corn bread was so bomb! Lots of carbs. Corn was kinda burnt tho.

4.BBQ ribs were mediocre. Someone told me that the meat only falls off the bone if it's over cooked but I guess I like it overcooked. This ribs was yummy and saucey but it didn't come off the bone easily

6.cheesecake was light and creamy. Comes in a really small bowl so you can have self control

7. Free cotton candy that you can take out. Comes in purple, pink, and blue
8. Crab legs were fresh but small. Just grab a bunch so you don't have to keep going back and forth

9.Alfredo and marinara pasta and thai noodles are so good!! The pasta was cheesy and hot. Thai noodles was kinda plain but I'm fine with it

10. Gelatto: mint, chocolate chip, passionfruit, vanilla flavors: yes I have tried them all in one sitting...shhh

It has attracted people like us who has been busy shopping the whole day and by the time we reach our hotel with our shopping loots, we are left with limited options for a dinner buffet. 

The only pros I can think of is it closes late at 11pm whereas other places closes 9 or 10pm. But well that doesn't mean it's a good thing after all. The seafood (mussels, prawns and crab legs) doesn't look that fresh but I still did give it a chance and try it. Crab legs is sweet but very salty, taste that it has been soaked in salt water. Cold prawns does not look appetizing too, and worst the mussels...look like it's been taken out from the freezer and they just unfreeze it. I felt so disgusted by the mussels.

Cooked food is average, nothing fantastic. Desserts look cheap...mostly cupcakes. Cupcakes look home-baked and very child-like. Presentation of desserts is horrible. I'm a dessert lover and I didn't even want to try anytime that is how bad it is! Even the ice cream looks cheap!

- mussels that looked like they were cooked 3 days ago
- sloppy, uninspired, visually nauseating ""Asian"" and ""Mexican"" dishes
- polish sausage looked good, but I was unable to chew more than once before spitting it back on my plate
- oyster shooters (which I typically love) looked terrifying
- I'm almost sure the Bloody Mary's in my ""all you care to drink"" add-on were virgin, and to give them any flavor at all you had to spice them up at the laziest Bloody Mary bar ever put together by human beings

The only bright spots were the salad which was a solid average salad bar (at least the lettuce was fresh) and the very above average dessert station.

I got this from their website but it's spot on, We were in vegas for a bachlor party last weekend and this place brought us back to life after long nights! i had brunch here twice!!! It was delicious maybe just good hangover food, But damn when are you not hung over in vegas?

The weird fake looking pizza that i normally wont even try at a buffet was pretty damn good! i had to check it out after my buddy's were talking about how great it was. The shrimp was pretty decent and the veggies were even kinda fresh.

My favorite plate i had was filled with biscuits and sausage gravy that didn't just fall apart when you stabbed them with your fork, And the gravy actully had peices of sausage in it not just flavored that way, Eggs that were so so i guess can't really mess up scrambled eggs, French toast that was just delicious and crab leggs stacked to the roof... I never thought i'd eat crab legs for breakfast much less occumpanied by french toast. Maybe i was really muffed up but it was deliscious. Throw in a bunch of free beer and champagne to wake you up, with a few crazy stories from the couple next to you and now thats how to start a day in vegas! 

I would recommend it to anyone. Im sure there are better buffets in lv but i doubt theres anything near as good for the price, save your money for alcohal and clubs, nan",3.56,kyle,36,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

So to start the reason for the two stars and not one was simply they have grab legs and prime rib at a half decent price.  Now to start the details of this horrible experience.

The service:
Ok to start 4 of us went to dinner this evening, my wife and my friends wife are full Mexican however they look white and are fluent in both English and Spanish. We ordered a round of Coors light's and bloody marry's. The drinks came and the beers were seriously room temperature and the bloody marry's were so spicy they were undrinkable. The waiter overheard my wife and my friends wife speaking Spanish, and started conversating, we later found out through conversation in Spanish only now that the waiter saw ""us white people"" and kept poring in Tabasco and grabbed the warmest beers he could find. This was just so him and his fellow staff could have a laugh. As soon as he found out we were Mexican and spoke Spanish the quality of service took a 180. Without asking the waiter brought us 4 ice cold beers, new bloody marry's and wine for our wives. Our drinks always got filled and he even brought all of us beers and drinks to go plus two decks of playing cards. I found this to be a complete joke and no wonder why tourism is down.

The food:
The food was of a typical buffet, the crab legs were ok, the prime rib was ok as well, although in my opinion it was over cooked. I did feel the buffet was a bit smaller then the ones I had been to at the other casinos. The deserts were horrible, and some of the worst I had ever seen at a buffet. I tried every single one and not one was I able to muster a 2nd bight and this wasn't just me all four of us at the table felt the same way. The ice cream was the only desert I was able to eat and it wasn't to bad either I think it may have been made in house. 

In summary I will never go back to this buffet unless I hear that it gets revamped, nore do I recommend this buffet to anyone.

Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.

Came here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.

I can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces. 

Couple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon ""sushi"". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll. 

For about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of ""ehh"" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food. 

P.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor.

The hot crab legs were a tasty treat and once I got the hang of cracking I was on my way to butter crab soup heaven!

The downside of this buffet is the selection really, they have a star like crab legs and the rest of the food options are just mediocre.

I had two rounds of salad because the selection of items was limited and I rarely get repeats at a buffet. A lot of the food was just not visually appealing, a lot of it looked dry as if it had been sitting for a very long time. 

My friends got a serving of prime rib, it was overcooked, tough and dry unfortunately.

The desert bar was good, I did get my fill of Gelato and cupcakes :) I forgot to snag some cotton candy to take home as I had thought about previously. However they were not making it and you know out of sight out of mind. They have the cotton candy machine there however they are not really making it unless someone request it. They have plastic bags so I don't understand why they don't make a few bags for people to pick up. 

Word of advice, if you don't plan on getting your fill of crab legs on your visit then go to a different buffet as there is simply not enough of a selection to be able to get your fill or moneys worth.

Also my friend and crab legs eating buddy really enjoys the additional and optional add on for unlimited beer, wine and champagne (9.99). She can go through two or three damn bottles of white zinfandel in one sitting. I have tried doing the unlimited beer and wine just once, but it is just too much to eat and drink like that. I can eat a lot but not on a belly full of alcohol, hell no. 

The buffet is small, really not a whole lot of other options of food items. They need to switch up their items, it is the same buffet line every time. I pretty much know in advance exactly what I will be consuming. No surprise as to what will be available at the buffet. I mean come on, think of us locals that visit on a regular basis.

It's all about the crab legs, I feel like a crab leg whore with every plate I devour.

Variety is the spice of life, come on Harrah's. I know they can do better than this, I have faith!, nan",3.52,Nikki,417,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

I go for the crab legs, my gal pal goes for crab legs and the all you can drink wine/champagne. She can drink two to three bottles in a visit!

The sushi (according to him) was pretty darn good, especially for a buffet. It seemed quite fresh still and tasted pretty good. I had a Philadelphia roll that was good.

They brought a huge glass, which is exactly what my hangover was needing. They had a decent selection of donuts, and their cinnamon rolls were excellent, as was this caramel custard. They only had a tiny bit of dim sum (shumai), and it was just okay.

Luckily for us we got here a little before 4pm so were charged lunch prices.  You just end up staying for an hour or more and they start bringing out the dinner foods.  Unfortunately since it was around the holidays, prices were more expensive than they normally were.  Since we came between lunch and dinner there was no wait.

The selection of food here is pretty typical.  They have a meat station with prime rib, turkey, ham, and rotisserie chicken.  The sushi station is pretty miserable...just a few rolls that looked gross so I didn't even try it.  Their Italian section has some good pastas and lasagna.  The best were the meatballs...so yum!  They also have a chinese station with rice, chow mein, wontons, etc.  Surprisingly there was still breakfast selections as well with eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.  I don't bother touching salad at a buffet...gotta get your money's worth and only amateurs fill up on salad.

The best part is the shrimp cocktail...shrimp were a decent size.  They also brought out crab legs later for dinner but I was already kinda full by then.

Desserts are decent.  They have a gelato bar.  I tried the tiramisu flavor which was way too sweet but the mint chocolate flavor was much better.  The chocolate cake was also good but a little on the sweet side.

Food: Snow Crab legs offered both hot & cold & they were much larger than the Rio sister property which touts Rio buffet. Delicious crab meat.  Peel & eat shrimp also excellent as were crab or shrimp gazpachos & mussels . Didn't sample the crawfish as I not a fan but they have that too.
My dining companion loved the prime rib but I just rate it an OK as the small rare slice I had was a little tough & the carver who did not speak English well kept motioning for me to do something with my plate which I finally figured out was take it out of the way. Anyway, a small distraction!
Desserts good. Liked the caramel brulee & hand scooped ice cream though skip the cotton candy unless you in need of a sugar fix.

Just a couple of minutes before that, my wife and I had our photo taken with a 5 foot spoon and fork that the resident buffet photographer then tried to sell to us for $25 during dinner. 

I had a couple of comps for the ""Buffet of Buffets"" that were about to expire.  Even though we pretty much only do buffets when friends and family visit, we could not let these babies expire without using them.  The line for Paris and Planet Hollywood's buffets were over an hour long when I called so we ended up here.  No line!  No surprise.  

We were last here 5 years ago and not much has changed.  The most significant thing was that they got rid of their chocolate fountain and now give out bags of cotton candy.  The best things were the crab legs which were larger and tastier than the ones at the Rio we had a day later.  I also liked the carving station and the dessert area so we mainly just filled up on those.  The salad, Mexican and Asian stations were all mixed bags.  I heard the mashed potatoes were great....

A family of 5 sitting next to us were already on dessert and as we were about to leave, the father got up to speak to the manager to complain about the pasta being cold.  He said it ruined their dinner so the manager fully refunded them!  They were already on dessert!!!

I was so hungry and didn't feel like walking back to Mirage or Treasure Island, both of which have great food, excellent service, and reasonable prices. So in  a rush to get some food I settled for Flavors. Wow! What a mistake. 

Upon walking up to the cashier to pay for my meal, all three cashier continued their conversation, looking at me, saying nothing to me, and talking for over 2 minutes. Finally I said ""can I pay here to eat in this buffet"" and they looked at me liked I had stolen their kid. Isn't the cashier at the buffet suppose to take your money. And from here it only gets worse.

The hostess seats me at table next to a 80 year old man that has no respect for the space around him, or himself. The piled plates, the newspapers scattered around his table, and the booth on both side of him covered in his thrown about newspapers. The hostess tells me to sit and leaves all the newspaper on my seat. I looked at her like she was crazy and she pushed the papers slightly for my butt to have a clear space. 

From here... oh god, the food is disgusting. Fat and grizzle in the roast beef so bad you can't chew it. Old crusted over foods, and empty containers of food everywhere. 

After I sit down and eat my food I finish my soda, I say to the waitress can you please get me a diet coke and water. She snaps back...""this isn't my section, I am off."" Now she is clearing tables, and is dressed like all the other servers, and she is the only one in my area. So I say..""can you please find the person who is working I would like a diet coke and water."" She says, ""let me see what I can do.""

She asked us how thirsty we were because if we were thirsty, she wanted to bring us each two glasses because she didn't want to have to make extra trips back to our table just to bring us another drink.

We went for Sunday brunch and the line was maybe 10-15 minutes long, not too bad.  It cost approx. $25 but we had a coupon for $5 off per person.  Good thing too, because the food here was definitely not worth $25.  

At first glance the buffet seemed pretty decent.  It had a little bit of everything: traditional American breakfast foods (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc), Mexican (Spanish rice, tacos), Asian (sushi, dim sum, chow mein) and prime rib and fried chicken and salads and dessert items.  I loaded up my plate with just about everything and sat down to enjoy.

The first sign that this place sucked was that the scrambled eggs were God awful.  It didn't even taste like eggs.  It was like greasy yellow mush with a slight salty flavor.  C'mon how hard is it to screw up eggs?  All I could eat were a couple bites.  I moved on to the bacon and sausage and they were overcooked and really really really salty.  The prime rib had absolutely no taste to it, even with the very generous amount of au jus I put on it.  The Spanish rice was very undercooked and seemed like little pebbles.  The sushi was just plain disgusting, there were no other words to describe it.  I also couldn't find any soy sauce anywhere, no matter where I looked.  I had to ask a worker and he brought me one.  I don't understand why they didn't keep one next to the sushi area.

Finally, I just threw up my hands in despair and went to get a donut.  A plain, glazed donut.  I figured they probably weren't cooked on the premises so it had a better chance of being pretty decent.  Unfortunately, Flavors Buffet managed to mess up the donut too.  It was stale.  

I totally understand why everyone bashes this place----they totally deserve it.  If not for the fact that the workers were very nice and friendly, they would get 1 star from me., nan",3.38,Steve,69,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

Most of the food I got was really good. The pastas are awesome, the prime rib with au jus and creamy horse radish sauce is comparable to a middle-end steak house, and the Asian foods (mostly Chinese) taste just like panda express, which is a plus in my book.

I was somewhat disappointed with the fresh seafood selection since much of it didn't taste as fresh as I would have hoped, and the crab legs that everyone always goes crazy over were mediocre at best. Also the dessert selection is rather limited, but tasty none the less.

While they stayed, they gambled. Nowadays, most hotels offer a budget-priced buffet, which represents excellent value if you need a blow-out.


 Flavors is a great place to satisfy any appetite and features continuous live cooking stations, freshly prepared seafood, all-you-can-eat crab legs and fresh cut Prime Rib, an array of delectable side dishes, traditional comfort foods and a variety of pastries prepared to perfection.


 Flavors represents cuisines from around the world, including Churrasco (Brazilian BBQ), sumptuous pizzas and Italian casseroles prepared in a wood burning oven, fire-roasted rotisserie chicken, piping hot steamed crab legs and tasty Asian selections such as hand rolled-sushi, Maki Rolls and homemade wonton soup as well as traditional Southwestern dishes. Flavors is one of the most diverse buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. For dessert, Flavors features a gelato station with homemade sorbet, gelato and ice cream.

I remembered the buffet being yummy with lots of options and most importantly AFFORDABLE.

So when my brother and I ventured over to Vegas for a turn-around trip, I suggested we hit up this buffet to stuff our faces so full that we wouldn't even consider spending money on food for the rest of the trip. 

The food wasn't as good as I remembered but it still did what it was supposed to do... fill us to the brim.

We only made it 3 plates in before noticing a new addition to the buffet service... the option for unlimited alcoholic drinks for only $9.99 per person!

The unlimited drinks option includes domestic bottled beer, mimosas, bloody mary's and wine. It is available all day. So really, if you committed, you could buy it for lunch and sit there drinking for 5-6 hours. 

I only wish this deal was available without the purchase of the buffet because OH MY GOD... we were sooooooo full after eating and then drinking 6 mimosas each in 45 minutes.

We had stopped into the buffet with 1.5 hours until it closed. The first half hour was spent getting food, eating food, losing our table in the sea of tables, arguing with the waitress because I thought our table had disappeared, getting food, eating food. The final 45 minutes of our time in the restaurant was spent chugging mimosas.

I'm not sure if you have ever tried to chug mimosas, but it is not easy. The carbonation really starts to catch up to you. The first two went down easily. The second two took a little more effort. We started stirring the mimosas before drinking them to make them a little less filling and bubbly. The fifth was a challenge and required some inappropriate pre-drink belching to clear space. The final drink was downright painful. Our bellies were full of food, alcohol and carbonation. I was very surprised that the final mimosa didn't shoot right back out of my mouth for lack of space. 

Our discomfort and over-consumption would not have been possible without a very attentive server who completely understood our goal. The mimosas were stronger each time and he was beating us to the punch by delivering our next mimosa as soon as we finished the previous. He even gave us two final mimosas that we just couldn't finish so we gave them to the neighboring table. 
We left the buffet clutching our stomachs and waddling a little. But we were happy and a little buzzed.

So long story short; if you go to this buffet, are of legal drinking age and want to challenge yourself with unlimited drinks... show up earlier so you can take your sweet time. The food is good and isn't expensive but the unlimited drink deal is even better. Go Harrah's!

The meat is juicy and salty with a hint of sweetness, such perfection should be a hell-sent sin. This is the only place I go to satisfy my urge for crab legs. All the other foods are just great, they have different sections for the different ethnic foods (because racial grouping is only natural even in foods) and I don't remember putting something in my mouth that I didn't like. Prime rib and aus jus was juicy and full of flavor, the perfect combination. The line is never sickeningly long, it's always a moderate length.

Oh, If I could describe every single thing I ate at this buffet I could publish it into a book but for your sake I won't. Just trust me and try this buffet. You'll get your money's worth.

BTW: They have unlimited Gelato! And cotton candy to take home! (faint!), nan",3.8,Vicky,128,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

h70Yele5HoVKnTVGfgAloA,0_LZEAYsexEZS-OFTjdjNQ,2012-01-14,1.0,"I saw the ""Buffet of Buffets"" listing on Yelp for iPhone while looking for a place to have breakfast after waking up around 3pm. (That's what Vegas is about, right?) It was rated 4.5 stars, and was supposed to be a good place to grab breakfast. (I figured there should be a better 24-hour breakfast spot on the strip, considering it's Vegas and the place is all about gambling/partying into the wee hours of the morning. I was hoping that's what this was going to be.) Man oh man, was I disappointed!

Going to the address on that ""Buffet of Buffets"" listing actually brought us to Flavors. So, I'm rating Flavors, and I'm going to go ahead and forgive that my expectations of finding a decent breakfast at 4pm might've been a little unrealistic. (Hey, I still think that'd be an attractive destination for a lot of people. A 24-hour version of San Jose's Bill's Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-san-jose) would knock the socks off of folks seeking a late breakfast on the strip.)

Here's what I found at Flavors. (Granted, it was 4pm on a Thursday. You may get better results at a busier time, but it wasn't an interesting enough place for me to bother giving it a second shot.)
* Waited 6 to 8 minutes to be seated -- place was not busy and no one in front of us in line. Could've seated ourselves...
* Lots of the food was way under temp. I'd say just about everything I tried except the soup were lukewarm and probably a food poisoning incident waiting to happen.
* Cheese ravioli -- might've been good if not cold.
* Penne pasta with alfredo sauce -- might've been good if not cold.
* Italian sausage and kielbasa were OK but lukewarm. Would've been tasty if it were hot. But nothing special here.
* Egg drop soup -- the base was unimpressive and did not seem very authentic, but they absolutely sank the ship by putting veggies in it that gave me the impression of Veg-All.
* Sushi/seafood I didn't dare touch after finding how poor a state the hot dishes were in.
* Fruit was OK but not a good selection (all they had was honeydew and grapefruit wedges).
* Every type of bread I could find was stale/hard/dried out like it'd been sitting out too long. (The corn bread and dinner rolls both had this problem.)
* Coffee was acceptable and, thankfully, nice and hot.
* Had some vanilla ice cream for dessert. Had to ask the attendant behind the counter to scoop it, but that was OK, and she was very nice. Unfortunately the ice cream was the one part of my meal I really enjoyed.

Overall, the food not being maintained at sufficient temperature just killed this place for me. The price and service didn't do anything to redeem it.

Visited on a Friday evening around 9pm when you would think a buffet would be at its best since the dishes are being refreshed frequently, but if this was Flavors at its best I shudder to think of what its like at its worst.

The crab legs were suprisingly good for a buffet, especially considering the quality that you get on the rest of the buffet.  Desserts were undoubtedly the highlight.  Small portions so you can try multiple offerings, and every single one of them was great.  Plus the gelato station was a great touch.  

Nothing else on the buffet was even restaurant quality.  There are Italian, Asian, Mexican, and traditional American sections, plus a salad bar, and I tried a bit off of each section and there's not one thing that would have been acceptable if you ordered it at a restaurant.  Even the low tier buffet chains around the US like Golden Corral, Ryan's, Furr's, etc crank out better food than this.

Service was ok.  Great on refilling drinks but it took a while for used plates to be cleared.

If you're getting comped or gluttony is your thing then go for it.  Or check your insulin level at the door and splurge on nothing but dessert.  Otherwise stay away.  It's terrible., nan",4.14,Scott,22,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

However, if you need a quick meal and don't mind flagging down your server for a refill on your beverage, you'll be just fine here. 

Food - It's standard mediocre buffet food. Nothing stood out aside from the surly ""chefs"" who made it a point to show their dislike for their jobs. One woman noticed there was no more lo mein and asked nicely if it would be refilled. The ""chef"" in the back shot back (say this in a surly tone) ""If you would just give me a minute I'll fill it up"" and eye-rolled his way away from the woman (no idea if he ever did get around to refilling it).

Service - It was sad watching our waitress...she was 60+ years old, hard of hearing, and couldn't remember anything. At one point she had a tray full of drinks and she put it down on an empty table and said ""I don't know where these go."" Another time she was walking around with a drivers license and $20 saying ""I don't know what to do with this"" even though the guy who gave her the ID and $20 to order a beer was all of three tables away (she finally remembered).

I do like the fact that they ask you when you pay what you want to drink as it means you don't have to sit down and wait for the waitress to come before heading up to grab your first plate of slop, but that's where the compliments end. The rolls were hard, the salad bar doesn't offer a whole heck of a lot, the shrimp is peel and eat (come on!), and...and...ok their fried chicken was pretty decent.

Service still stunk like the last time...our waitress would run away for 5-10 minutes at a time (where she went nobody knows...was she at the craps table?). I left nary a dollar for her as her apathetic attitude made me sad inside.

I was thinking it might be all kinds of awesome sauce since the line snaked out to a solid 20 min wait. Weird thing is they weren't even filled to capacity inside. I'm thinking this may be nothing more than a clever ploy to make people think there's greater demand than in reality. 

Of course, I could also just be reading into things way too much. 

A dinner for one adult is $25, which is a decent price if you're planning to seriously gorge yourself until your stomach hates you. The theme to this buffet is that all the major cultures are represented, so you can dine on Mexican, Chinese, Italian... whatever you want. 

The hit of the night was the endless crab legs. I think they were billed as King Crab legs, but these must have come from a midget king because they were small and tiny, like T Rex arms. I still loaded my plate with enough to feed three people. 

Everything else was of varying quality. The Italian fare had some passable sausage & peppers. The pastas were OK. 

I grabbed some beef curry from the Chinese section, but the rest of their offerings made Panda Express look high end. 

There was a dude cutting up prime rib who looked like he would rather drown himself in au jus than continue slicing meat for one minute longer. It's always fun to pick out the employees in Vegas whose faces spell out a lifetime of internal misery from dealing with jackass tourists. 

They had bananas foster for dessert. Well, actually they have something like 30 different desserts, but one bite of that and I got instant tunnel vision. At least if I'm going to stuff my remaining pockets of space with food, it's a fruit. Sort of.

Lunch and Dinner are VASTLY different, and it really isn't just about the food.

We did the Buffet of Buffets (See details in my Le Village Review), and we had lunch and dinner here. Both times we added on the all you can drink for 10.00 (Includes beer, wine and champagne). 

At lunch time we get sat down in Rudy's area (Ask for him if you can he is AMAZING). I would have my champagne glass in my hand and he would fill in on the way to my mouth it was almost a game to see if he could keep my glass full, and boy did I try to beat him. He had my friend at one point with 3 alcoholic drinks in front of her. 

We never had to ask for a drink unless we wanted something different like wine instead of beer etc. 

The food was amazing, they had wood fire chicken, prime rib and pork. It smelled like a camp fire it was amazing. They also had cotton candy. I have never seen that at a buffet but it was AWESOME.


We went about our day and came back for dinner. Sadly Rudy only works the lunch shift till 3pm.

The food was still good, sadly the cotton candy was gone for the evening. However, we started with a female drink waiter. She was abrupt and very inattentive. I assume it was because it was the end of her shift because after she brought our first drinks we never saw her again. We had to flag down a gentleman that was in the area and after that he server our drinks and was pretty decent but we had to flag him down repeatedly and he didn't come over to the table just to check on us.

Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, it was all I got. =)))

Of course I consulted Yelp before heading to the Flavors buffet! It had good reviews and decent pricing so we checked it out! My friend knew of my crab legs addiction so when he saw one diner with crab legs on his plate, he told me about it and I made a beeline for my precious crab legs.  I cracked my first one and dipped it in the butter sauce and I was in heaven! It was so huge, so juice and soooo yummy!  Prolly the task of getting the meat out in one big piece and actually being successful at it adds up to my enjoyment.

If the rest of the buffet was good, I'd never know but I still give them 4 stars because of the reaction of everybody else on my table and mainly my happy crab leg-filled tummy.

A Spanish family walked in just in time before 10 pm, and seemed to have special treatment with the Latino staff. Their teenage daughter (tall, beautiful, and skinny) walks to the gelato place, and the server, being Latino, puts on a big smile and offers her samples and a cone.

On Thursday night, which was my final night at Vegas, I won $574 in a slot machine at Flamingo. I wasn't planning to have breakfast the following day when I checked out. However I decided to get breakfast for the following reasons: 1) I got a coupon for $5 off for breakfast as a Total Rewards Member 2) Instead of gambling I still can get points by eating here.

After the first plate I lost my appetite. Here's why. The first plate included scrambled eggs. I like my scrambled eggs wet but something was wrong with these eggs. They left a bad taste in my mouth and stomach. Gordon Ramsay said he could tell if a person can cook well if it knows how to cook scrambled eggs. Well someone should've vetted the person or people who cooked theses scrambled eggs. I ended only have three plates of dishes because of the scrambled eggs. The rest of the items were pretty good like ham, sausages, hash brown, and blue berry pancakes. But I always felt to determine how good a breakfast buffet is by how well cooked are the scrambled eggs.

Crab legs are cooked in SALTY Salty water and just sit in it and absorb all that salt and get mushy. Salty mushy crabs legs - so gross.

Prime rib was upwards of medium well,  cut your loss and switch it out, ugh.

Virtually everything just felt like it had been sitting in the window way too long.

Finally I went for the creme brulee, pretty hard to mess that up...

And they did....

It had no caramelized sugar on top and sat in a cold case... 

I thought to my self; 
""Oh how neat they caramelize the sugar in front of you and make it all fresh!""

No, they don't. There is no caramelized sugar to CRACK on your freakin creme brullee, they told me ""well there is caramel on the bottom""

It's not flaun, it's creme brulee damnit.

Not to mention it was totally instant mix from a box.

It was very difficult to flag down our servers for plate service and drink refills. 

We were seated adjacent to the casino floor, so the cigarette smoke from the floor kept sailing in making our dining experience less enjoyable.

What was really annoying was that they had no restrooms inside the buffet. Being that I didn't know the Harrah's floor layout, it took me about 10 minutes to find a bathroom. I'm surprised I didn't already pee my pants. 

Again, the buffet is nothing special and excels in nothing. Majority of the food looked like it had been sitting under the heating lamp or on the steam tray for a long time.

I have had both the breakfast and seafood dinner at Flavors and both experiences were remotely the same good food but poor service. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast selection which contained all the essential breakfast items and a few extras. At $16 dollars a person the price was comparable to any other breakfast buffet or a plate at your average eatery. 

Honestly, the problem was with our server who was rude, inattentive, and down right nasty. She totally ignored my table. She went around our area refilling just about everyone's glasses and checking on everyone but, my table. She would look in our direction then walk away. 

Again no problem with the food so I ventured back last Friday evening for dinner. I loved it! Succulent crab legs and cotton candy are defiently a win. However, a larger selection would have been nice. I also noticed the absence of fresh fruit besides bananas and honeydew melon. 

As before the problem was with the service. My server I believe her name was Jennifer was amazing. The problem this time was with our hostess who seated directly in the middle of the dinning room surrounding plenty of foot traffic.

Its stations include salad, seafood, Italian, Asian, Mexican, pizza, pasta, and desserts - complete with gelato, tiny tarts, and a chocolate fountain. I'm probably forgetting some type of food, but I hope you get the picture - an amazingly vast array of choices - even for a buffet.

For my first plate, I marched right up to the prime rib station and asked for a slice. I got it with the horseradish sauce - strong but in a good way - along with broccoli, a couple of red potatoes, and a piece of maki sushi from the Asian station nearby for my walk back to the table.  

The service was great. Our waiter was very experienced, once holding a tray of dirty dishes, probably amounting to almost 20. He joked with my mom denying her a change in beverage choice from iced tea to coffee, and we almost fell for it. When my Oma asked for a wet nap, he brought a small handful and knowingly said she could take them in her purse. Of course, the man serving the prime rib was friendly. The second time I came up and got less horseradish sauce, he jokingly gave me a hard time about not taking more. Even one of the other diners encouraged me to take more food at the seafood section. Hesitant about how many crab legs or shrimp to take, I got his support in thinking that I could finish it.

She basically said ""too bad"".  When she tried to give us a free buffet ticket, I refused stating it was a conflict of interest.  She go upset about that and stormed off!  

The place, like Harrah's in general, has really gone down-hill over the years.  I went to Palace Station and ate their buffet (which you would expect to be mediocre...and it is) but even the Palace Station buffet was better than Flavors.  Skip this buffet!

If you bought the 24-hour pass, go to Planet Hollywood (good but has gone down as well) or Paris.  Rio is always good.  Or, just save your money, go one block East from the Strip and go to Ellis Island Casino on Koval Lane and get a New York steak dinner and a great beer for $9.

This buffet is located in the not so popular Harrahs hotel and casino that is close to the heart of the strip. Also this buffet is included on the all you can eat 24 hour buffet that Caesar's entertainment offers. So let the review begin.

The first time I had tried this buffet was easily the best service I have ever received at any food establishment. So good in fact that I had to hunt down a spot on Caesar's website to send them an email praising the server Freddy for his attentiveness, caring, and incredible interest in seeing that we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience. e came to us many times, since we had finished our dinner he brought us some coffee for our dessert. He inquired about our trip and where we were from, then told us about his life and how he ended up in Las Vegas. All of it very nice and non of it intrusive or bothersome. Freddy was top notch. Moving on.

The second time we went was for breakfast so I can compare it directly with the Garden Buffet we had the morning before. Right off the bat it was not nearly as crowded and cluttered. Seating is more traditional buffet, big room lots of tables. The buffet is a long straight wall with key foods strategically placed. You can tell they pay attention to detail. Popular items of food such as eggs and bacon were located at three different spots at the buffet. This keeps the clutter down and not having thirty people waiting in line for the one dish of bacon or whatever. Also they give you a full carafe of coffee,     how perfect is that. No one else does that, no flagging anyone down for more, no waiting for fifteen minutes with an empty cup.

They do have some great items like gelato, donuts, cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, and cotton candy, yes cotton candy you can take for later. The food here is slightly above average, it is good for the lower end buffet that this is, but what puts it over the top and gives it an extra star is their attention to detail and impeccable service. Clearly they pay attention to the people they hire. The food is good, the service is great, the attention to detail is on point, and the location and seating is ideal, what is not to like about this place.

Even at a young age I knew this food model was flawed.... I ate here because it is located in the hotel we are/were staying in. The place is clean and the selection is plentiful. I had the roast beef, prime rib, ham, and mashed potatoes and it was very good: it was cooked properly and it was juicy. My wife had the salad bar and there was a solid selection and everything was fresh and well maintained. I should have stopped, but I thought why not... The shrimp, crab legs, clams, and sushi were all very bad. The crab legs were soggy and lacked meat, while the shrimp was very basic. The sushi rolls were hard and dry and basically fell apart before they hit my lips. Food aside the worst part of the buffet model is some of the people... The types are as follows: 
1. The over eaters - they take a lot and eat most of it. It's a bit troubling to see. 
2. The shover - they can't wait in line and need to shove other people to get to the food. I'm confident these people think the food will run out. 
3. The lurker -  They invade your personal while you are making a selection and then pounce once you move and proceed to gather food with the tenacity of an Olympic athlete. 
4. The waster - they take a bunch of food and only take a few bites. 
Finally there is the 5th and most egregious buffet goer:
5. The save it for later. Once done gorging on loads of food they take more to go. I watched a women put food in her purse!!!! 

While there are other types of buffet goers I think we covered the basic. After my experience here I think I will stick with table service mostly because of the above offenders.

If you're staying at one of the ""total rewards"" casinos, look in the coupon book you got from checking into your hotel. We got a $10 off coupon for this buffet-score! 
Being vegetarians who eat fish we were somewhat limited. Actually, we were mainly here for the crab legs. So in that regard-eat your heart out-as we did. The crab legs were good and plentiful and they had legs on ice and hot, take your pick. 
Like I mentioned, there wasn't much else we could eat here, a lot of meat options, but oh the desserts.....
I think they had about 20 varieties of mini cupcakes. My insulin level is rising just remembering this. We got one of each, hey no judgement-it's Vegas, and that way we could share and sample each one. So amazingly delicious. 
So essentially we had crab legs and cupcakes...a nice balanced meal. 
In summary, if you have the $10 coupon, it might be worth it for you if you're a meat eater. If not, skip this one., nan",4.05,Stephanie,463,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

Rudy kept our drinks full and the Churrasco Pork was to die for, and the $9.99 all you can drink beer/wine was worth every penny. I would rate it 6 stars if I could.

It was so good, we thought we would come back for dinner. But when we did, it was like we had come to an entirely different establishment. The entire mood and attitude was changed. Trying to get a drink refill was like pulling teeth, eventually the original lady that was supposed to be our server disappeared entirely and another guy pretty much adopted our table since we were calling out to him so often. The cooks were lazier at dinner than at lunch and didn't get anything refilled in a timely manner (particularly the Churrasco pork) and one of them was just plain rude. The 9.99 all you can drink was not as worth it this time as my companions barely got four drinks out of it with all the trouble they had getting served.

Between my six-star lunch experience and my two-star dinner experience, Flavors averages a 4 for on the whole.

yMEO4fsNxLpuFsZI3vGjPQ,0_LZEAYsexEZS-OFTjdjNQ,2012-12-12,1.0,"Overpriced!  I was very surprised at the expensive buffet price.  Around $80 for three of us on a Wednesday night.  Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese)
There was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess. 

Prime Rib was ok. No real complaints there. 
However, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.

They do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good.

We bought the buffet of buffets for a day when we arrived in Vegas at 1 pm on Sunday. 

What I like from this buffet were the crab legs, shrimps, prime rib and the galeto with waffle cone. Actually, this buffet has more taste than Wicked Spoon and Carnival World.

The crab legs were bigger and more meatier here and they actually scored them so you don't have to crack it open with the cracker yourself, how thoughtful of them. The chowmein actually had taste and siu mei was pretty good and warm considering this is Vegas not LA, the prime rib was tasty also. The waffle cone had a little sweetness in it and it was pretty fresh.

So overall it has more taste than the other three buffets I have afore mentioned.

Actually, we went back for lunch before we left Vegas on Wednesday afternoon, but this time they didn't have the crab, so not sure if they only served crab on the weekends or Sunday only.

Although this hotel and buffet might not be as new or fancier than the other hotels and buffets, will I come back to this buffet the next time I visit Vegas? We might actually., nan",3.07,Ken,93,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

The heat lamps over the food are really close.  The buffet has metal containers with lids that contain the dumplings.  Sometimes you have to pull on the lid pretty hard to get to the delicious dumplings.  When I yanked on the lid, my hand hit the heat lamp above and I burned my hand.  A little ice from my drink and it was all good.  But don't do what I did.  Just another safety tip from Holly C. Yes, I am clumsy.

Anyway, this was the 4th buffet in the UYE Buffet of Buffets circuit.  It's a nice buffet but lacks the nice view that the Lago and Paradise Garden Buffet have.  The pizza here was very good.  Thin crust, good flavor.  I could have lived without the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza, but otherwise very nice pizza.

The dumplings were also very good, despite the hand burning incident.  They have hot sauce here for the dumplings, which I appreciate. I also enjoyed the gelato.

There is a VIP entrance off to the side for Diamond, Platinum, Seven Stars.  I also think you can buy a line pass here to get into the buffet faster if the line is long.

I don't think this buffet has an all-inclusive champagne option. At least it was not offered.  But it was one of the rare buffets where the servers offered us coffee afterward.  Usually you have to hunt down a server to get it.

We stopped in on Saturday for the Champagne Brunch.  It was $25 per person, but comes with unlimited champagne, which shockingly was not offensive!

Crab Legs: I was fortunate to be the first to receive a new tray of crab legs. The crab legs were sweet and although they were steamed, still retained a lot of flavor and were very enjoyable. 

Pizza: Shockingly the kitchen has a wood fired oven. They cook the pizza in this oven and it is very good. Three or four different types of pizza were available (I chose the vegetarian), but it was thin crust and I really can't complain.

Sushi: The sushi here was a challenge. They only serve rolls here and unfortunately the rice was hard, and the fish of inferior quality, stay away from the sushi.

BBQ Pork: Wow, they have some Brazilain style pork that was a little overcooked, but seasoned to perfection. Oh and the sausage was very, very tasty too.  Had I not filled up on crab legs, I would have been all over the pork and sausage.

Dessert: To me the dessert is the real strength here. Tons of different options. I chose to indulge in a waffle cone with gelatti. Awesome way to end the meal!

I wanted to go to what, in my head, is the best buffet in town (Carnival World at the Rio) on Chirstmas Eve of all days. I naively assumed that it wouldn't be THAT crowded, turns out the line for the buffet was almost at the door and the Rio was a total zoo that day. Since we wanted to get the Buffet of Buffets pass anyway, we decided to go to Harrah's since the shuttle stopped right there.......I really should have waited until tomorrow or have taken my chances with Paris or Planet Hollywood. Very disappointing, and not worth it's full price of $25 (which is, shockingly enough, the same as the Rio).

First off, the wait was much longer than expected, and it was largely because the line to get seated was almost as long as the line to pay. I understand that this was a very busy night, but we could see loads of open tables from where we were standing.

Secondly, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A CHINESE SECTION WITHOUT EGG ROLLS? SERIOUSLY. 

The only above average items in the buffet were the desserts (I know, everyone raves about the crab legs at this buffet, but the line for crab legs never seemed to end so I decided to skip it). 2 interesting things to note about this buffet are that they make and serve cotton candy and they are one of the few buffets in town to serve ice cream and/or gelato in waffle cones. You are also allowed to leave the buffet with them. I think I ate more sugar at this buffet than anything as everything else was so mediocre. 

It's also quite possibly the most oxymoronic buffet in town. How are you going to have international stations and yet not even the basics of that cuisine are available (see: egg rolls for the Chinese section and tamales for the Mexican section). Thank god we grabbed the Buffet of Buffets deal, so at least we can easily make up for this disappointment.

We had bought the buffet of buffets pass and had already been to three other buffets on the strip and those three had set the bar pretty high. 
    First, when we walked up there was no line for cashier at all but maybe ten people waiting to be seated. We thought, ""great, finally won't have to wait in line for 30 minutes."" Wrong. People just kept walking up one after the other that were diamond members so they skipped right past us. It just really made us feel low class getting passed over for at least 30 minutes. 
    The food was ehhh... okay. At best. Compared to Planet Hollywood and Paris it was about McDonalds quality. Not much selection and the desserts were behind a counter so you had to ask for each thing making us feel like we had to settle for just one or two items.
    The service was AWFUL!! I overheard the hostess say to the server that she will have to stop seating because the two servers couldn't keep up at all. We didn't get our drinks for at least 15 minutes and then never got a refill. There was a bus person that got plates once the whole time we were there.

Take an apple or a bananna from the buffet and put it in a bag to take with you. Last thing you want to do is be charged $50 for an apple at the Bellagio.

Steak taco was the least good. Topped with guac and salsa, interestingly the steak was somehow very smokey tasting despite them grilling it before my eyes. Had the flavor you'd get if you threw a steak into a barbeque with wood chips. The flavor was good, but seemed out of place in a taco.

Spicy pork suffers from false advertising. Not at all spicy. The pork inhabits a vertical spinning spit usually seen at your favorite Gyro spot. It's basically a take on Chinese Char Siu (Roast Pork). They've even colored it red and have a pineapple at the top of the spit which they give a squeeze to every once in a while to keep the sweet glaze going. Quite interesting, although not as juicy as I'd like since they seem to have kept mostly lean pieces.  A shame.

The chorizo is their masterpiece. you order it and they cut a link loose and burst the insides out of the casing onto the grill followed by some sauce. I'm at a loss for words, but not appetite.

0G610-TDrz1TspoIoIDH9w,IRYj1b1-mlXqABVsl9SoqQ,2012-06-18,2.0,""" the carne asada tacos and the adobada tacos are bomb here!"" "" those are the best tacos I've had"" please......

All I could hear from my friends is them talk about this place n San Diego.  How good the tacos are and what not.  They found a Las Vegas location and insisted we go when we got there on our Vegas trip this past weekend.

Arriving at the restaurant, the employees wanted us to make two lines ( for the beef and the pork meat ).  My gf said lets split up in the lines so we could get our orders.  We decided to order:

1 taco of shoulder meat
1 taco of stomach meat
1 taco of carne asada
1 taco of adobada meat
1 order of adobada fries

The employees gave me a bit of an attitude until they forced me to speak Spanish.  They gave me my orders and went to the GF to check on the fries.  She was still waiting for the order and said they were taking a bit long.  I talked to the cook there and he was like she didn't order anything and putting her down.  I switched back to Spanish mode and told him to make the order ( with an attitude ). If that wasn't enough, the cashier girls were giving my gf attitude when she was paying because they couldn't understand that she was paying for the fries and I was paying for the tacos.  Back to Spanish mode, put them down, explained to them in a way you explain a 5 year old how to do things because obviously these people came from Tijuana yesterday and think they can give customers attitude when they themselves can't understand English in the US.  Really pissed me off that these immigrants like to talk smack in Spanish when you don't speak Spanish.

Going back to the food, I had my eyes set on the carne asada tacos and adobada ( since everyone is ranting about them). I couldn't be more disappointed in the flavor of the meat.  The asada taco's meat was tender, but really bland.  I guess cause its so bland, they smacked so much guacamole on the taco to make up for the flavor ( which made it worst).  The adobada taco meat was really dry and no flavor either!  What was the hype about??  Surprisingly when we were tasting the stomach and shoulder tacos, we were like OK that's pretty good.  The shoulder taco was kinda like carnitas style with some of the broth it was cooked in.  The stomach taco was not all chewy and nasty texture.  Had some of the broth that it was cooked in as well.  These two tacos were the best ones out of the others, how ironic ha ha.  I think the brain, stomach, head and shoulder meat is all cooked in the same broth.  The fries were pretty good too.  They were thin, crispy fries smothered in some salsa they make there.  Personally me, that salsa was OK but too much on it.  Again, the adobada meat did not help the fries.  You might want to eat the fries as soon as you can or else they will become soggy from the overload of salsa they put in.

This place really did not live up to the hype.  Rude employees, flavorless meat and expensive tacos.  I would have given this place a 1 star, but the shoulder and stomach tacos managed to change my mind.  I would like to try the head tacos,brain tacos, tostadas and quesadillas next time, but I feel like it wont be for awhile since it would have to be because friends wanna go and has to be the San Diego location.  If the San Diego location is just as bad with the immigrant workers and attitudes they give, I will gladly say I'm done with this restaurant.

0VbbBcvwxXfhtarJl3N5vw,IRYj1b1-mlXqABVsl9SoqQ,2012-06-26,5.0,"So, this trip to Las Vegas was essentially a post-deployment treat - one that I went on by myself as to get the freedom to do whatever the heck I wanted - including playing 20 straight hours of poker at the Wynn, which is the reason I found Tacos El Gordo - which I believe means Fat Tacos.

2 a.m., I drunk, walking down the street - just about the only tacos I was going to get to eat at that time was a real one - and I wasn't going to complain.

Stepping into Tacos El Gordo is to be transformed from Las Vegas to Tijuana - in fact, the owner says they are formerly from Tijuana, which I often visited as a kid. Dirty, scuzzy, and authentic - that's about the only things I can use to describe this place. 

Although there are about eight different types of tacos - each costing about $2.50, I opted for the stomach and tongue tacos - both culinary delights I'd learned to eat having grown up in Southern California.

In my best Spanish, which I failed both in college and high school, I ordered two of each, and an Horchata (a milky, cinnamon drink). The guy behind the counter looked at me with amusement, and in lightning speed, whipped up two of each. After paying for it all and putting a few bucks in the tip jar, I went to my seat only to be summoned back and given an extra side of meat. 

""Shoulders,"" he said. ""Try it.""

I tried it and instantly fell in love (the next day I came back and ordered more) - it was not only flavorful and full of spices, one could almost taste the nutty, meaty taste of the cow cheeks. I was in taco heaven.

Onto the tongue and stomach, however: stomach tastes exactly the way you'd expect it to - a bit slimy, but flavorful with a hint of bitterness. No worries - a bit of lime and salt takes away the flavor that you might not be used to. I quickly wolfed it down and then tried the tongue.

Subtly beefy - that's the only way I can describe it. Tender, moist, and full of flavors, it also packed a beefy flavor that no way in hell Taco Bell could deliver - new 100 percent meat be damned. It's also a light meat - that is, it's beef, but doesn't come with the heaviness that beef often is known for. It is, in a sense, as soft and gentle as a baby's sigh - heavenly goodness.

I washed it all down with the drink I mentioned - the sweetness cleaning my palate with each swallow, allowing me to go back to the tacos and tasting everything packed in it each time.

The next day, I went back for more. In fact, during my eight-day stay, I ate at Tacos El Gordo five times - each time leaving me satisfied, but also longing for more.

If you do go there, I recommend the tongue and the shoulder tacos. I also recommend the Horchata. What's more - get the little vegetables that are left to be eaten over a bed of ice. They are meant to cleanse your palate. Take a bite of it after each bite of the tacos (or if you're like me you shove the entire taco in your mouth), and I promise you'll be ranting and raving about this place, too.

Another note: do leave a tip. These people work really hard, and they do a good job serving. You're in Vegas - you're going to splurge anyway. Might as well make someone's day., nan",3.57,Marc,35,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

Despite the number of time I've been to Vegas, I wouldn't consider myself a ""Vegas person."" I dunno, everything on the strip seems to run together after a while, and you can't really tell the difference between this place and that. Enter Tacos El Gordo! You have to walk a bit away from the action to get to it - just north of the Wynn and Encore, Tacos El Gordo is located in a weird little strip mall next to a souvenir shop. They have seating indoor and out.

When I walked in, I was faced with a food station directly in front of me and a cashier to my right, horchata/bang/soda machine on the left. I was totally confused as to where to order and how to pay. It must have showed on my face because one of the guys behind the counter where the cooks were smiled and called to me. He took my order, barked it at the cooks and told me to wait there, then pay when I got my food. I was totally surprised at how cheerful all the employees where. Great customer service is definitely not something I seek out when I'm eating at hole in the walls, but every employee greeted me with a smile and was happy to serve me. When the cook handed over my food, he asked to make sure the order was right, gave me a big smile and told me to enjoy. I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.

I had the carne asada fries, an asada taco, chicken quesadilla, and an a pork taco (I was sharing with a friend OKAY?). Everything was perfectly delicious. The carne asada fries were huge, enough to feed 2 to 3, possibly 4 people. The tacos come overflowing with meat, and the horchatas and bang juices are refillable. Woohoo! I felt like I struck gold with this place. And our whole bill was only $20. I think it was the least amount of money I had spent on a meal that satisfying in Vegas. If you're looking for some good, cheap Mexican food on the strip, drive or walk a little further, Tacos El Gordo is worth it., nan",3.8,Linda,194,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

Tacos El Gordo is a must visit place for my buddy and I when we're in Vegas.  It really is that good.

The minute you walk into this place you will notice it is insanely BUSY, and that most people are on the pork line-- because it is the best item on be menu. Don't get me wrong, steak is also tasty, but the pork is excellent on any menu item. Here is what I normally order.

Campechana fries, half order. These fries are smothered in steak or pork, cheese, cheese sauce, guacamole, sour cream and their special sauce... Virtually a food group of its own. Beware you can probably share your fries with three of your friends and still eat plenty.

Pork tacos: I get them with everything and a bit extra of their green sauce--a cilantro based sauce.

Mulitas on flour tortillas: there are topped with the same ingredients as the tacos but the ingredients are sandwiched between two flour tortillas with grilled, melted cheese on them. Amazing.

It's not far from the main part of the strip, just a few minutes past the Wynn in this janky strip mall area, but you can't miss it since there is a big sign at the front of the building.  

You walk in and order right from the guy making your taco/burrito/nachos/fries/meat, and you can watch them making everything fresh.  I was especially excited that they were pressing and cooking their own tortillas on the grill right in front of me.  The way they cook their meat reminded me of a churrascaria, including the pineapple heads on the ends.  You could see the juice dripping allllll the way down the meat as it cooked on the spit...oh man. *drool*

We had just 1 carne asada fries to share between 3 girls and 1 carne asada taco to try.  This was more than enough food for us for our late night cravings.

For the uninitiated, it is absolutely worth visiting if you are a fan of authentic Mexican food.  Just beware of the ridiculous lines during lunch and the silly ordering system that works in theory but fails miserably in execution.

When you get there, you'll see that there are multiple lines for each of the meat stations.  Each station is supposed to be dedicated only to a particular type of meat or meats, but the lines aren't labeled and it's more of a free-for-all to get to the front than anything else.  To further cause problems, people will wait in one line (carnitas for example), but when they get to the front they order something that's supposed to be from another station (asada for example).  This causes delays because the guy at the carnitas station will have to ask the guy at the asada station to make something for the guy who stood in the wrong line in the first place, which causes both lines to get further backed up.  Confused yet?  Yeah, it's a big mess.

But let me save you the trouble of having to wait in multiples lines.  I've tried pretty much all the meats, and I can confidently say the only meat that really makes this place unique/special is the adobada (spicy pork aka al pastor).  It's frickin' delicious!  The meat has a perfect balance of crispiness and juiciness, and is packed with salty sweet flavor.  Whether you get it in a taco, tostada, quesadilla or whatever, I guarantee it will be good.

3 lengua tacos
3 spicy pork tacos
1 campachana fries
2 coke zeros--you know, cuz we're trying to watch our figures.

I loves me some pork so of course I ordered the adobado (sp) tacos for myself. I thought they were really good, however I don't think they are as good as the al pastor from Tacos Mexico. The ones there come very greasy and seemed to be slow cooked amongst ingredients such as onions that you can clearly see on the taco (aside from the toppings). I love the greasy, juiciness of that type of marinated pork. It seems I've only been able to find them at Tacos Mexico.

Anyhow, my sister and I swapped a taco and that lengua taco on MY lengua blew my mind! So tender and juicy! I already thought I discovered the best lengua tacos in town (Super B Burrito) over by Eastern and St Rose so I didn't have high expectations. God, I love it when I'm proven wrong in that sense.

The campachana fries were delish with half of it topped with carne asada and the other with the spicy pork. All in all, great food especially after sitting under the sun getting drunk. The restaurant was very clean, as well as the bathroom.

For carne/beef, line up on the left.  For pork, line up on the right!  My usual order is something like 2 adobados + 1 carne + 1 lengua taco (have a friend order all the carne, and another order all the adobados, otherwise you will have to line up twice!)

This is a must-go if you are in vegas - cheap, delicious, tasty tasty food! Convenient parking, available seating.  What more can you ask for?

Last time I came, however, half of their kitchen had been closed down for some reason and the wait time was ridiculous (close to an hour around lunch time).  On previous visits, my wait has always been around 20 minutes long around the same time (we have a habit of going right after hotel check-out, before driving back to socal!)

=========
LOCATION
=========

It's located at ""the edge"" of the heart of the Vegas strip in my opinion. I consider everything from like Excalibur to the end of Wynn the HEART of the strip. Sure you've got the Stratosphere etc. if you go down farther but with Sahara being remodeled, there's a deadspot past the Wynn.

Anyway this place is RIGHT past the Wynn/Encore, on the Strip, headlining a little mini-mall. Seating is limited inside, BRUTAL due to the Vegas summer heat... and there's a ton of seating outside. Unfortunately the inside is pretty small and the lines tend to make things chaotic.

Also adding to the chaos is there's 2 separate PAY AREAS inside, both on opposite ends of the place. They hand you the food cafeteria style BEFORE you pay, which is cool. What I hated was there's 4 stations and depending on WHAT TYPE of taco you want you have to go to the different stations/lines. One for Abogado (spicy pork), one for Carne Asada and Chorizo. Finally a third one for all other things (tongue, shoulder, brain).


=========
THE FOOD
=========

~ CARNE ASADA TACO - The steak was seasoned amazingly. It came with an avocado mash and some other great toppings. (5/5)

~ ADOBADA (spicy pork) TACO - This was interesting. The meat looked delicious, nice seductive red glaze to the meat. It was pretty good, not amazing. However the green avocado sauce they put on it bumped it up a bit. I recommend adding that sauce on ALL your tacos. (4/5)

http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oCNAyy80KNhlFskH_cio4A&userid=1pgT-Eeh-GIOlhOgHMMRZA


~ MULAS - I ""think"" this was a giant taco with an additional tortilla atop it. (4/5)

~ CHORIZO TACO - It was pretty good as well. Torn between giving it a 3 or a 4. They chop up the tasty looking sausage in front of you... and the grounded meat streams out. (3/5)

~ QUESADILLAS - These aren't your normal ""quesadillas."" They are a large taco w/some cheese burned into the tortilla, filled with meat / toppings with a HARD-AS-ROCK CRACKER thing put atop kind've like a hat. It's really terrible. (1/5)


=========
AND SO.....
=========

It was a good spot. 
Definitely a good place to go if you're balling on a budget. Can't beat $2.00 tacos and $4.00 MEAT quesadillas. I think there was a lot of locals here. I'm curious what the VAMPIRO was. My friend MIGUEL Z. thought these were the best tacos he'd ever had. 

As a tip, ask the person who makes your food for some peppers... they're free and they'll only give em out if you ask. You get a big plate of like 3-4 types of grilled peppers and grilled onions.

Some downsides are that El Gordos always seems busy and it is probably not the most efficient ordering experience if you want multiple kinds of tacos given that there are separate lines depending on what you are ordering. If you are going as a couple or as a group I would suggest coordinating your order and splitting up amongst the lines.

Cheap tacos and horchata - any decent combo of these two automatically starts at three stars for me. In this case, the extra star is for its location. The adobada tacos were pretty awesome. I thought they'd be a little more tender, but the sauce was fantastic and there was a perfect amount of spice. The carne asada tacos were good too, but the adobada were better in my opinion.  And unlimited horchata refills for a little over $1.50? Yes please! I was really looking forward to the grilled green onions, but they looked and tasted more like they were steamed. I know they were grilled though, since I saw them sitting in a pile on the grill. It was just overcrowded so most of the onions didn't get much contact with the grill.

No air condition swamp coolers instead
Rabid flies especially outside
Seriously smokey from the cooking
Very unhealthy, greasy, and the pork was red

Found this place mentioned as a top choice on several websites, especially when researching the best cheap eats in Vegas.  Granted, they are not necessarily cheap for street tacos ($2 to $3), but compared to prices in Vegas as a whole, Tacos el Gordo is a bargain!  During a lunch break during a business conference at the LV Convention Center, my friend and I came here.  Expecting huge lines, we prepared for a long wait, but it turned out that lunch time is a pretty good time to visit.  According to my friend, the lines are absolutely huge during the late night hours, after the clubs get out.  Anyway, I ordered two of their famous spicy pork tacos, one beef shoulder taco, and, because I wanted to be adventurous, one beef brain taco.  I had each one ""with everything"" and all of them were delicious!  Without a doubt, the two pork tacos were the absolute best...sweet, savory, spicy...full of flavor!  The beef shoulder was excellent to, a bit stringy, but overall very tasty.  The brain taco was...interesting.  With all of the accompanying toppings, it was very tasty, but it was the texture that was the most different.  Creamy is probably the best word to describe it.  Would I order one again?  Probably not, but I am very glad that I tried it.  Was it filling?  After eating my four tacos, I felt thoroughly satisfied.  I was by no means full, but happily fed (for about $10 mind you) and looking forward to a future visit.

The food here is really good, but the restaurant itself leaves a lot to be desired.  First off, they have a chaotic system of ordering food on one side, then paying on the other side of the room.  It's not a common setup, and it seems you have to be a bit pushy to order your food.  People here seem to ignore you, or people cut in front of you.  It seems either people have bad manners or this restaurant has employees who only respond positively to other spanish speakers.  It could also be that my friend isn't the pushy rude type, but the people taking orders wouldn't acknowledge him.  

I think it's tragic that even though the food is pretty good, but the organization really sucks!  If you want one type of meat, you stand in one line, if you want another, then you have to stand in a different line.  They had 4 different lines!  I wish they would just handle orders in the back.  It's as if they think their employees are too dumb to handle orders of different types of meat.  He might mix up the carne asada with the adobada!  They look totally different, but who cares, my employees are too stupid to tell the difference!

 I really don't get it.  I might expect this sort of chaos at a food truck or an outdoor swap meet, but in a restaurant there's a much better way of running things.  It's not like the way they have things setup makes things faster or easier.  In fact, I could see someone easily ordering food and just walking out without paying because it would be impossible to tell who's paid and who hasn't especially when it is busy which it seems to be  during lunch and dinner hours.

I also found the prices to be a bit high in light of how terrible the service runs.  I'd understand paying more for food in a restaurant that is organized and nice, but with all the chaos and terrible service, I don't know why I""d pay any more than any taco truck.  Overall I'd say stay away unless you find the place mostly empty, then it wouldn't take you forever to order your food.

I usually get 3 El pastor tacos..they are a bit spicy and they come with creme yum yum m getting so hungry thinking about them.
I've had carne asada tacos..which are very good. The tacos de lengua (beef tongue) are sooo good too. These are my moms favorite. Dont be afraid to try it because it sounds strange. 
The tacos ""de sesos"" have to be my second favorite. Yummy these are my dad's favorite.
I love them all but just the el pastor tacos are worth going. 
They also have ""aguas frescas"" They have horchata which is delicious and i always get it and they have others..there is one drink that taste like oranges and creme which is super good too., nan",3.33,Su,57,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

They freshly shave the grilled spicy pork off of the rotating stack and sprinkle it onto perfectly crispy french fries topped with fresh FRESH guacamole, cheese, and sour cream. Equally delicious whether sober or highly intoxicated. The small size is more than enough for one person.

So the first night we were in Vegas we were planning to come after a night at Hakkasan. We drove and got there about 4:40 and Yelp said it was still open but when we got there it was closed. Disappointment. So we tried again the next night to a VERY packed restaurant with multiple lines. The way everything is formatted is ridiculous! I have to wait in multiple lines to get different types of meat. So there is a line for carne asada and you can have anything from tacos to sopas to nachos but you can only order carne asada in that line. If you want other meats you will have to order in one line and then go to the next. 

After waiting in the long line you take your tray of food and go to the register to pay and then take a seat anywhere. The only good thing was that the drink was all you can drink of horchata and orange bang.

The guac was probably the best part of the meal because they put so much on the taco but the taco itself was only ok. Nothing special at least not for the way and how everything is formatted.

To the far left you got the adobado, middie is the carne asada and far right is the counter for brain, intestines, stomach, lengua (my favorite!!!). You can make about anything with the different types of meat. I tried the Carne Asada fries, carne asada taco, mula con adobado, tongue mula and adobado fries. I actually had a Tacos El Gordo Sandwich (what is this??)...which involves TWO visits to TACOS EL GORDO within a 9 hour time frame with my first and last meal of the day being at this establishment with some more foodie (Korean bbq) and Las Vegas show in between. Probably my most BIG GIRL night in a long time. 

They also speak Spanish to you like you know Spanish. So brush up on your Spanish or get lost in translation. Drinks are $1.40 and there's only one size...BUT you get unlimited Ole drinks (mmmmz Orange Bang....). Indoor seating is scarce because they get filled up so quickly.

Came here one Friday after Tao. Got my fave tripas tacos and their orange bang. My drunk friends got a plethora of tacos and carne asada fries. Omg --- SO GOOD! Orange band included; it wasn't as frothy and creamy (more watered down) than I would like but, it'll do.

In fact, El Gordo was SO GOOD that we came here the next night after The Bank. lol
This time, we decided to change up the meat and had TRIPAS FRIES ---- oooOOooooOOOooooooooohhhhhhHHhhhhhh. Talk about LIFE CHANGER right there!

Well, let's start with: This place rocks. 

Let's get into it. You need some greasy food after an epic night, and sometimes Tacos are the cure-all. Do not miss the opportunity to eat here. It's located on the northern end of the strip just passed Encore & Wynn. 

There is usually a line, but it moves quick. 

You have plenty of meat options for your tacos (hey now). I prefer the more adventerous stuff like lengua, cabeza & tripa. Totally worth it because everything is seasoned to perfection and greasy enough to be amazing.

If you are on vacation and have no regard for your arteries (aka if you are like me), then try the carne asada fries. It's massive and something that can easily be shared amongst 3-4 people. Or just split it with someone if you are both cool with a challenge.

Maybe they were having a bad day (I notice another 1 star reviewer went the same day I did).  Quite simply, the food was inedible.  First off, this is a place that LOVES their organ meats.  No fish or chicken tacos here so keep in mind that choices are very limited if you don't like tripe, brain, tongue or head tacos.  That's ok, we went for the carne asada fries, Abodabo and spicy pork tacos.  Fries looked awesome.  First bite....my mouth filled with fat/gristle/tendon.  Ick.  I'm a good sport, tried another bite.  Huge piece of fat.  One more bite.  Same thing.  Moved on to the abodabo taco.  First bite.   Fat.  I wasn't dumb enough to try another bite.

You walk in and see the meat behind the counter, place your order and watch as it is made, then take your tray up to the cashier to pay. It doesn't get fresher than this.

The lengua is amazing. I don't care how you feel about eating another animal's tongue, it's delicious- especially here, and particularly in the fries. Lengua quesadilla is also tasty, but the bottom tortilla is flour and the top is a tostada... so it's a little odd. Eat it anyway.

Best tacos were the spicy pork and the beef shoulder, honorable mention to the super-crispy tripas. Ordered all as-is with the salsas and sauces. These people know what they're doing.

Now for the lengua fries- a half order will run you $6, pricey for fries. But worth it. It's a giant portion of salty, crispy fries, topped with a healthy (NOT!) portion of lengua meat, sour cream, guac, and cheese. It sounds revolting but it's amazing, and it doesn't taste as heavy as it sounds, either- which is a bad thing because I could put away a lot of this dish.

I came here around the dinner hour and it was busy but not slammed. I ordered the adobada based on the Yelp recommendations. SO SO SO SO GOOD!

I also ordered the asada which was good too, but not amazing like the pork.

That did not bother me very much though; it was the cashier who counted the number of tacos herself, overcharged me an extra taco, and failed to give my receipt when I paid for my food. After getting seated, I realized that had happened. I quickly went back to the cashier to let her know so I can get a free soda since I didn't want to wait in line for a taco.  Due to the language barrier, a coworker of hers explained the situation. The cashier refused to admit she overcharged me and did not do a single thing to make matters better, even after I did the math and showed her the amount I was charged in my credit card. If it were an accident, that's totally understandable. I think it was intentional. On the flip side, I really enjoyed the tacos despite the ordeal. Anyhow, just watch out for this kind of thing. I know it seems silly to trip about $2, but it is the way the situation was handled that can make any meal turn sour.

I HIGHLY recommend:
1. Carne Asada quesadilla - PACKED with steak on a soft thick tortilla with lots cheese, pico and guacamole.

2. Buche tacos - pork stomach that has been simmered for HOURS until tender and highly seasoned. 

3. Spicy pork taco - cut right off the spit fresh for you.They also add grilled pineapple at your request. Excellent

4. Tongue taco - seasoned and tender. 

I personally think these are BETTER than most of the tacos I had in Tijuana. But the sign here says they are from Tijuana so I must have missed them. Hard to remember anything in Tijuana actually. I could have ate here and just forgot from all the tequila I drank while I was there. Who knows?!

The parking lot sucks to get to and is jam packed.

There are separate lines here depending on which meat you want to eat.  Look for the signs at the front of the line.  When we came in the whole inside of this place was packed.  It was very confusing for me in the beginning, but K.O. helped me navigate through the madness.

We stood in the Adobado line and got us 2 tacos and 1 mula to share.  Remember to ask for hot sauce when you get your food.

Adobado Taco - the meat was cooked well and on a spit. When you see meat on a spit you know its going to be cooked well, charred slightly on the outside and moist in the inside.  All the trimmings were delicious and that green sauce was really creamy and helped elevate the flavors.

Adobado Mula - First time trying it and its basically 2 tortillas with meat, cheese, and other things inside.  This was delicious and wish I had found out about this sooner.

After you get your food, you have to find the cashier line and pay. When we were here the horchata tasted really watered down and not good. The orange bang on the other hand was delicious.

Seating may be hard to find, but we found one outside fairly easily.

The place could be a little cleaner and less hectic.  The inside is crammed with ppl and hard to get refills on drinks.

I would definitely come here again but maybe one of their other locations., nan",3.74,Kenny,74,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

The place was packed with people so there is a little of a wait for the tacos. There are multiple lines that you order from and only make a specific taco (ie: one line for carne asada tacos, one line for lengua and cabeza tacos, another line for adobado tacos, another for chorizo, etc). So if you want to try different types of tacos you pretty much have to stand in 3-4 different lines. The best way to get a variety of tacos to try here at an efficient rate is to come in a group of 5 and divide and conquer. I spent most of the time standing in line and trying to figure out a more efficient way of running the place instead of standing in multiple lines. You pay afterwards at the two different cash registers when you've picked up all of your food.

The best taco was the Adobado (sp?) - spicy pork. Loved it. So tasty and the sauce goes really well with it. The adobado quesadilla was great too. 

Carne asada was okay but a little tough. I had it with some fries which made it pretty good.

The lengua was okay and it was all right with the fries we ordered. 

The pork shoulder was dry and tough. I would pass on it the next time.

So all in all, the spicy pork is the one meat that I would come back here to eat. Props to the place for  having orange bang and all of the other fresca flavors. Free refills too! Great to have on a hot day in Vegas.

Seating is limited because there are only so many tables. If you're willing to sit outside in the heat, there is a tented area that has some additional seating., nan",3.48,Ivy,468,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

I had to constantly deal with other customers pushing through the lines to get to the soda machines.  Other than those things, the food was good but definitely try different meats.

The tacos are seriously STUFFED with meat, onions, cilantro, and sometimes mild sauce or guacamole depending on what kind of taco you order. Just a tip for preferential purposes, you can even order corn tortillas which are somewhat bigger than the standard size tacos. Remember, you have to ask for all the sauces when you pay for your food.

On the other hand, they serve fries! Be mightily warned that the full size rack of fries is HUGE. So unless you have a somewhat normal appetite and stomach, feel free to order the full size, otherwise, I highly recommend the half rack so you can get some tacos. They have carne asada fries, but my favorite is the campechana fries. The campechana fries consist of asada and adobada(similar/identical to pastor). And included is your standard set of sour cream, onion, cilantros, guacamole, and etc. 

This is conveniently located northbound on Las Vegas Blvd ahead of Wynn/ Encore. Which makes it the perfect place to fulfill your drunchies after a night at Surrender or XS.

My co-eater pal like the crispiness of the meat--and I can always appreciate meat cooked to the point where I can't feel the fat, but this made it a bit tough to eat... I prefer a little more tenderness. 

Bottom line: Compared to the mediocre buffets all over the Strip that cause you to indulge to your stomach's limits, this is a quick and easy place to eat just enough while getting some bang for your buck., nan",3.26,Rebecca,598,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

Tacos El Gordo runs all night long to cater to those party people who literally just got out of XS...... and are super hungry!

Be aware of the long lines!!!  It sort of goes quick but nevertheless it's still a long ol line to be waiting in...

Quick eats for after clubbing!  Which Taco would you like?

They are famous for the pastor taco!  Spicy Shaven pork on the spinner rotisserie is a crowd favorite!  But they also have tons of other stuff as well!  (gotta try their super nacho!  It is humongous!)

Here is a tip for all future visitors!  Don't just have your heart set on tacos!  From my personal experience, if you get just tacos you get smaller portions of meat!  Try the other varieties as meat portions are much much more than just simple tacos!

They've got free refills on drinks!  Including Horchatas!

You want sauces to go with your meal?  Ask for it as you are paying the cashier!  He/she's got it in a small fridge behind her!

Again, all sorts of meat options for you to choose from, and when it's real busy, they got both sides going at one time so it help speeds up the process!

To me... it's not the best tacos I've had, but the lengua was delicious!

Maybe the perfect after clubbing snack?  It's for you to find out!  Try Tacos El Gordo next time you are near!, nan",3.79,Henry,389,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

If its crowded which it was for us, don't expect to find a place to sit and eat your meal.  It is lacking tables or areas to enjoy your tacos.  So you stand in specific lines and those lines only serve those items otherwise you have to stand in line again.  The organization of it all doesn't allow you to get a variety of tacos.  Different if you are not used to it.  We settled for carne asada tacos and wanted to get the spicy pork but again didn't want to begin all over again.  When we got outside there were people whose family members were still in line who had grabbed any table and just waited.  Meanwhile we were looking to find a ledge, a chair, and finally settled for a curb near the restaurant.  There were cockaroaches near the curb that we were sitting at and well, again...no tables which lowered my rating for the restaurant.  Otherwise the food is very good.

I don't know why but somehow I seem to always find myself coming here once in awhile; people do flock over to this location because its on the Strip.  Go to the Charleston location if it's busy here it's not that far away.  Honestly I like their food only when I'm either drunk or recovering  but I could probably get the same effect from a Roberto's which is probably more convenient. Any other time I just can't enjoy them.

When it's slow, which is when they're usually still busy but manageable, you can find a parking spot easily, you walk into the building, open the door and shut the door, you wait in a decent line, and you can enjoy your meal maybe on a table inside or outside.  However when it's busy, mainly weekend, forget about coming here, unless you're willing to wait. The line usually spills out the door and it's hard to find a seat.  You'll likely find yourself joining others eating their food on the curb or at your car. 

Food-wise it's alright 3 star maybe 3.5 tops which isn't that bad.  You probably heard about their carne asada and adobada fries, and their various street tacos they are a must if you never had it but personally I don't think they have enough flavor to my liking and seemed a little pricey, especially for the fries. I think I only liked them the first time I've had street tacos.  It kind of has phased out of my system, I do prefer a few other businesses more. 

Overall they are probably a 2 star maybe 3  mainly because of the inconvenience and madness that goes on. Yea it's busy because a lot of people want them but they could do something better to manage the crowd besides making the food faster, I don't know maybe it's just me being picky but definitely not a fan of the atmosphere. You can say it lacks good customer service but they do make things fast.

Wait in line for few minutes, order tacos as one order, pay at the cashier, and enjoy delicious tacos.

So much for the ideal world ...

Once you walk in, you will see separate lines for different types of taco (two lines for adobada, two lines for asada, one line for fries, and ..... ONE line for beef tongue / tripe / beef shoulder). 

So I lined up and waited to get one beef tongue taco and one beef shoulder. So I waited ... and waited ... and waited ...

Why did it take so long? Oh I see, everyone was ordering at least 10+ tacos for each order. Taco El Gordo, how can you only have one line for beef tongue / should line? Anyhow, and so I waited for 30+ minutes ... 

Finally it got to my turn! And guess what? THEY RAN OUT OF BEEF SHOULDER -_-! Dude, not cool at all. I only ordered beef tongue and beef tripe tacos. 

In the end, I basically did not want to wait in another line and I just simply overpaid for a $10 carne asada fries because there was no line. Oh, did I also mention it took them another 10 minutes just to get the fries out?  

Well, these tacos better be amazing right?

tacos de lengua (beef tongue - $2.25 each) and tacos de tripa (beef tripe - $2 each): For $2 tacos, they tasted okay. Is it worth 30 minutes wait? Hell no!  

Taco de adobada (spicy pork - $2): Probably the best taco out of all three that I've ordered, but it wasn't crazily good. 

Carne asada fries ($10): Not like it was awful, just not at the price that I paid for. I still can't believe I paid $10 for somewhat average fries ($5 would be a better price).

That's was  until my hotel recommended Tacos El Gordo. Tacos El Gordo is located on the no so nice end of the strip, near Circus Circus and the Riviera. Don't expect anything that you might typical find at your average sit down Mexican restaurant. Here you'll find street food, tacos, tostadas, etc. Couple that with a very nice covered outdoor seating area and somewhat limited indoor seating giving you the best of both worlds, street food with a place to sit down and eat. Here will find a very basic menu of inexpensive fare.

I can highly recommend the spicy pork and steak tacos, the pork being something special which is sliced off a rotating spit as you order. Tacos while small come over stuffed and sloppy with meat, cilantro, onions, guacamole and sour cream. For sure nothing comes out of a can. If you feel adventurous among other things you have a choice of tripe or beef brain tacos. Just keep in mind the menu is very basic, all items in Spanish with most having English translation. Taco's run $2 each. 

Service is very friendly and helpful if you have a question. Lines can be long, but move quickly. Here you'll find locals, not tourists. Long lines of locals are always a good sign, and it holds true here. The place is very clean.

And that saying a lot since I was sent to the drunk tank that very same day (not my fault, drunk person grabbed me and dominoe effect, voila!).

Anyways, al pastor...spicy porn rotisserie style greatest mexican meat ever. They have the perfect blend of herbs, sauces (some type of creamy guacomole), meat, and double tortilla which they heat up first. Tacos are 2 bucks but so worth it, I always get four. Right after the taco joint across the street from Papa's and Beer's, Tacos El Gordo is my second favorite taco. 

They have other interesting meats too like intestines if you are feeling adventurous. However, don't get the vegetarian quesidillas...my friend happens to be a vegetarian and they charged him full price for a meat quesidilla when there was only cheese....

Sort of hard to find, go down Las Vegas Blvd past Encore and you will see it on your right if you are heading towards Circus Circus.

A bit confusing with different lines you have to stand in base on what you want. 
We asked the cashier and she explained it well. 
You can pay ahead of time or pay after you order and get your food. It's $2 a taco. 

We got the beef tacos (Carne Asada)- It was okay. Maybe overly cooked, kind of chewy.  Not memorable.  3/5 stars.

We also tried the park tacos (Adobada)- mmm... taco heaven. Tender. They refer to it as spicy pork but it's not spicy. The taco tasted amazing. You can have pineapple on the side or on it. Same for the cilantro.  Throw some lime on it and boom ...5/5 stars! 

We didn't try the other items. 
We highly recommend the pork tacos. Went back again just for them on Sunday sept7 evening.  The second time we went, they were cooking the pork at both stations and had to wait 10mins. This was around 6:30pm. Both evenings the line up wasn't too long. 

Negative- Most of the cooks were wearing hats. One was wearing a hair net.  It can get pretty hot and they were working hard. Lots of sweat. With the cook sweating that much on his face, it was not appealing to fear lots of the sweat dropping on to the meat as he was chopping it up.  Our cook wiped the sweat off his face twice when it looked like it was going to drip on to the food. Luckily none did. But a bit hunger killing seeing that.

It's really interesting inside the place because they have separate lines for everything. I guess it makes sense since they're so popular!

Perhaps even the best tacos in the west. There are other locations, like the one in San Diego, but there is something special about this place. The taste is very authentic, from the hand made tortillas, to the meat, to the fresh salsa and guacamole. If you love going to Tijuana for tacos, but hate the crossing the border for two hours plus... then this is the place to go. Just like TJ, but no need to wait to come back. 

Only issue is the line / crowd control... there are two lines, one for asada, one for everything else... and the line for asada is usually about 20 - 30 minute wait to order, while the other is very small usually under 10 minutes... but you don't know about the two lines until you've waited in them for a while. But there is a PRO TIP here... offer the guy in the alpastor line a nice 3 dollar tip and ask him to order a few asada tacos for you... works every time ! (Of course this only works in spanish... but it works).

besides the huge lines, this place is the best... even after waiting 20 minutes... I still give it five stars, cause there is nothing like it... best place to eat in Vegas : ), nan",4.0,Gus,9,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

He kept going on and on about how great the tacos were.  He mentioned how they had these killer asada fries and how the tacos were authentic baja style.  So before we leave Vegas, the foodie brigade and I, (Rogelio, Jorge, and Blanca) make a stop at Tacos El Gordo.  This location was in a little strip mall and not in the best area on the Strip, but maybe that made the tacos better somehow.  As soon as you walk in the chaos hits you.  There are several lines and depending what you want to order, you stand in that line and order.  You get your food and then pay the cashier.  Figuring this out was hard, thank goodness for the adobada guy.  He took the time to explain it to me and even called me Chula.  He made sure he got my full order without having to stand in the other lines.  My friend took advantage of this and made me get his order to.  The food was delicious, but the stand out for me was the tacos de lengua.  I am really picky when it comes to eating lengua (tongue), but it was so juicy and delicious I had to go back in and order some more.  Although I had to wait a bit, the adobada guy chatted me up and remarked about how the tacos would taste just that much better after my wait.  

Asada fries delicious...they have this really tasty creamy green salsa.  Tacos OUTSTANDING! oh and they have grilled green onions, jalapenos and chile güeritos...not the pickled variety but the yellow ones.  No one ever has those and those are my favorite.

The homemade tortillas are about the size of your palm.  A taco with everything comes with meat, onions, cilantro, lime, salsa and a smooth avocado sauce that wasn't exactly guacamole.  I also had a quesadilla, which is the same thing as a taco but with good white cheese stuck to the tortilla and a fried tortilla on top.  

Order your tacos first, then go pay at the cashier to get your cups for drinks.  There's a soda machine and an horchata machine, the kind with the happy face logo that says ""Ole!""

The fries with meat (carne asada, adobada, or a mixture of the two which is called campechana, I think) is a three-pound box filled with everything your cardiologist doesn't want you to eat.  Cheese, fries, crema, meat.  You can share this among four people and you will probably still not finish it.

Tacos are two dollars each.  A meal with a drink will be about $10-12 dollars, which is a lot for a taco joint.

However, the people watching is first-rate.  Besides Mexican families and the occasional adventurous Midwesterner, customers include hotel workers, drunken frat boys, and honest-to-goodness prostitutes.  At the table next to ours, there was a lively and profanity-spangled discussion in Spanish about the true definition of a chilango.  On the patio, a group of young men in their early-twenties with matching vests and threaded eyebrows fortified themselves before a night of what would no doubt be the liberal distribution of rohypnol.  All of these people and more you will find at the Las Vegas Strip Tacos El Gordo.  All united in taco solidarity.

When you exit the day club, head down the stairs on the right on to the strip and go north (yes, north - away from all the hotels) for a block.  This will be located in a strip mall on your right!

Here's how it works: there are different ""stations"" for different meats.  You stand in line for the meat that you want to order (asada and adobada are at different stations), you order, they make it for you on the spot, and then you take it to the cashier to pay.  

I usually order a mix of 3-4 tacos and tostadas.  The fries are tempting but I haven't tried them yet.  The asada tostada is my favorite - I like that the tostada gives it a crunch vs. the corn taco shell.  The adobada is pretty fricking good too, with the cilantro cream sauce and some diced pineapples.  YUM!  I've heard the lengua is good but I have never tried it.

BTW, if you don't make it out here in Vegas, the original (?) is in Chula Vista in San Diego.  If you're in the area, it's definitely worth the drive down to almost the border for it!, nan",3.88,Joyce,250,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

We came on a Sunday afternoon, and the place was literally packed with Spanish speakers so that's always a very promising sign. Due to the crowds, it can be confusing as to how to place your order. But there are different lines for each type of meat. (Adobada- spicy pork was in a line by itself all the way on the left). Have a friend stand in each line and order in bunches.

As a group, we got carne asada fries, adobada, chorizo, and asada tacos. I think the asada was just ok on the tacos and the fries, and next time definitely get the adobada tacos. The spicy pork has so much flavor and the right amount of heat and watching them slice off each piece gave the reassurance of its quality. Chorizo also had a ton of flavor. I would definitely place Chorizo and Adobada above Asada.

I had the Spicy Pork and it came with this liquid green sauce that I wasn't so sure what it was... It already had the guac... so was this liquid quac?

I don't see what's so special about Tacos El Gordo. The presentation of the taco was not so nice. and it was really difficult to eat because everything was just thrown on top for me.

This place is unforgettable; from the long lines to cooking in front of customers, they are as good as it gets!

I totally recommend the Adobada (spicy pork) Fries because not only is the line shorter, but....it is roasted on a metal rod!! All their meets are cooked to perfection in front of everyone; that way, they have to stay even if it's a long line. 
Their workers are pretty nice; I've heard they are actually from main Mexico so their techniques are directly from there. This explains why they are so authentic, at least in my opinion.

This spot is a transplant from Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico.  
I had something that is called a ""Vampiro"" from a street vendor in East LA a few years back and was never the same.  They were some of the most amazing secrets of Mexican food I had never discovered up till then.  Sadly the vendor was robbed at gunpoint, not having enough money to buy new equipment.  

It can never be as good as those original Vampiros to me, but thank god I have come across somewhere I can find them now this side of the border.  Just order them, don't even worry about what they are.  I am sure many have given the description in their review.  

Also, the al pastor vampiro which are also called adobado.  The line for this meat is long and dedicated given the amazing taste of the meat and you will see the line form behind the giant rotisserrie for the pork, capped off with a whole pineapple on top which allows the juice to drip all over the meat., nan",3.68,Tim,349,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

To order you have to queue in different lines according to which tacos you want: one line for spicy pork, one for tongue, etc. and then bring your tray to the cash, pay and hope for a table to be available (or take your order to go).

I will tell you about my tastes for one second. I am a minimalist. I usually order things on the side or plain, especially with Mexican food. I do this because my tongue can't handle much heat despite the fact that I am 1/2 Mex. So, my honey and I met at The District to take our son to My Gym on V-Day, and he brought along tacos from El Gordo to surprise me. I had never had their food before this. I opened up the plate, and was thrown off because the pork looked like the sweet pork from Chinese places. You know how it is slightly reddish on the outside? Okay, mine was meat and tortilla only and his had a mix of cilantro/onion plus a few pieces of pinapple on top. To be honest here....I totally lifted my nose to the idea of fruit with my taco. When we were done there happened to be one taco left. I just couldn't let it go to waste! I took a bite with everything on it and.....IT WAS SO GOOD!

Now I wish my other tacos were like that. The lesson to my story is this:

If you don't step outside your comfort zone once in a while, you will let all the joys of life pass you by!

These delicious tacos from heaven only cost $2 each. No rice and beans available here, but I don't give a damn. Who wants to stuff yourself with fillers? The crowds are huge at lunchtime but it's only because these little yummies are a force to be reckoned with. By far, they are the best Las Vegas has to offer., nan",3.93,Teigan,100,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

Chose to stand in the Adobada line since it was the shortest and seemed to be moving the fastest.  Would have preferred to try the Asada but wasn't worth the wait.  After about 15-20 minutes of waiting in a line in a hot and crowded room, we get to the front and I ask the guy what else I can get in the line and he said he would recommend the beef shoulder.  We ended up getting 4 Adobada tacos and 4 beef shoulder tacos.  I was extremely skeptical because I just didn't think it was worth the wait and being from LA, I've had what I considered great tacos before.  Well, this place topped them all by a large margin.  I would recommend both tacos that we got.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and cut fresh, and the Adobada was cooking on the vertical spit.  The Adobada was perfectly cooked with a smoky flavor that I don't think is reproducible.  The beef shoulder was slow cooked and tender and would take too much time to do.  There is a wait but it is well worth it.  This place is the blueprint for how a taco joint should be run.  Quality food, preparation, and selection.

JYTFZQqKnzKIp9dLGoSPPg,IRYj1b1-mlXqABVsl9SoqQ,2014-09-03,4.0,"Pros:
-Lots of good food.
-The food is good.
-There is a lot of it.
-The food is cheap.
-You can get lots of good, cheap food all hours of the night.

Con:
-Lines are long.

Seems to me like the pros outweigh the con! This place is best approached with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Since there are different lines for different food items (one for asada, a different one for adobada, yet another for carne asada fries, etc.), you'll probably want to bring some friends, or stick to just one kind of food.

Everything is delicious! And it's cheap, so you might as well just try one of everything. They have nopales (the quesadilla is my favorite), so there are options for vegetarians, too (although if you're very uptight about it, this is not the place for you...your nopales will probably touch a whole lot of meat before ending up on your plate).

Ask for some grilled peppers and green onions to complete your meal, and stop by the condiment bar for extra hot sauce, radishes, and limes.

The tacos are small so if you are hungry get 3 or 4.  The people in front of me had about 5 people in their family and ordered about 30!!!  I kid you not!  So you know it was gonna be good!

Tacos El Gordo has been one of my bookmarks for a long time, yet somehow it wasn't until I was literally half a mile away that I decided it was worth the trip. I'm really glad I made that oh-so dreadful drive...

Even though I've been to similar places, it took me a while to order. I wasn't sure why everybody was piled up on one side of the ordering area. And then there was the empty ordering station on the right edge, which threw me off further. Eventually, I did find my way to the open al pastor station and the open assorted cuts station, and I got my tacos.

After paying (cash only, $2+tax per taco), snapping photos, and finding a seat (outside the off-peak yet still packed restaurant in this awesome tent with two heavy-duty fans and real tables), I dug in and enjoyed delicious bite after delicious bite. And yes, I can review meat by meat because I asked the guy in the kitchen to point out which was which. And I may have eaten some of these before.

- Sesos: braaaaains. You, too, can be a zombie! This is pretty creamy. Makes sense, because it's cow brains. (Not sure I can compare the flavor to anything, just try if it you haven't and aren't squeamish. And no, i don't have mad cow disease yet.)
- Cabeza: tender head meat. From a cow. You can taste salt but it's not salty. Came with a green salsa, same one as on the cesos taco, and diced onions and cilantro, same mix as they provide on all tacos.
- Al pastor (adobada): I've had the unfortunate experience of overcooked, dry, salty pork at other places. Not here. I actually saw the meat bubbling on the vertical spit, and it tasted delicious. They actually have a medium spiciness red salsa under the almost neon green, sweet sauce.

(Funny story with that al pastor. There weren't pineapples, so I asked if it came with them. Al pastor guy goes to the fridge and unwraps the foil from a large piece of pineapple, then sticks the pineapple on top of the vertical spit, and carves off a nice hunk from it. Just throws it on the taco, which I didn't mind since I can portion control with my incisors. A minute later, as I'm ordering at the adjacent station, the pineapple somehow comes flying into the boiling tray of meats and splashes liquid all over the sneeze guard. Dude didn't know where it went and looked around for a while until he finally saw it. Boiling tray station employee grabbed it for him and returned it.

Anyway, back to the rundown.)

- Tripas: pretty salty, not as intestinal as you might expect, crunchy from being fried, comes with that red salsa from above. I'd get it again, probably.
- Suadero: beef shoulder. Best purely savory thing that I tried here. It's beef, and you can feel the meat fibers, but it's still quite tender.
- Buche: chewy, visible stomach lining. Little salty and perhaps acidic, which isn't that surprising since it's, well, a pig stomach. Don't confuse it with pork belly, because that's something else entirely.

Huge credit to Tacos El Gordo for offering a quality, cheap product, especially on the Strip. I'd definitely come back here or check out their other Las Vegas location the next time that I'm thinkin' tacos (probably for cabeza, al pastor, suadero, and the lengua that I skipped out on). I'd also try the San Diego locations too if somehow I managed to check out all the other popular spots first., nan",4.02,Chris,623,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

I was actually really looking forward to this place and had high expectation for what was popular which was the adobada and carne asada. Since there was 2 lines to order, I told porky to wait in the asada line while I wait in the adobada line. I made the big mistake of trying to make an order to a wab without porky there. I asked for a big adobada fries without cilantro and he replied OK. I waited there for about 10 mins....

My bf already got his order and finally, he asked the wab where my order was in spanish and he replied that I never made an order with him, putting the blame on me, and trying to make me look stupid.. gtfo -_- I finally got my fries and I went up to the cashier. Without realizing it, the cashier girl gave me an attitude and my bf had to defend me telling them that I'm paying for the fries and he's paying for the tacos since I don't know spanish and I didn't understand the situation. how RUDE! I do not appreciate the fact that I was being put down for not understanding any spanish when we are in a country that English is the primary language, especially from people who sound like they don't even have their citizenships!! *slam fists*

In any case, on to the food. I looked at my food and I specifically asked for no cilantro, and of course they would fuck it up by leaving little pieces of it all over our food. I don't mind the cilantro but porky hates it. -1 point there for making me put the effort of playing hide and seek with the cilantros. The carne asada was ok. The meat was tender and juicy but bland. The only thing you could really taste in it was the guacamole since they slapped on a handful of it on the taco. The adobada tacos had no flavor whatsoever. I read that there was some pineapples sliced in it, the sauce was amazing but I did not taste anything on that taco. The best ones I have had was the stomach and the shoulder. I should have fought porky more for the brain, tongue, and head tacos since they were all cooked in the same way as the shoulder and stomach, but I gave in since porky was so adamant about not trying anything else. Never again will I let his closed mind affect my choices in food! Anyways, the fries were awesome! I love the sauce in it and the fries were the thin and crispy ones, not those disgusting steak fries. I just wish I got the carne asada instead because the adobada was flavorless and dry.

Anyways, I really want to like this place because I want to come back and try the other tacos, quesadilla, and tostada but I wouldn't want to come back here by choice because of the rude workers and there's nothing really special about their popular stuff. 2 stars for their stomach and shoulder tacos and fries!, nan",3.69,Rosa,229,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

Tacos De Adobada because I ended up in that line. Next time I will make sure there is at least 3 people with me so one person can stand in each line to order a variety.

The tacos were on your typical small duel corn tortillas flash fried in oil. The meat was sliced right onto the shells and then the tacos were dressed with fresh cilantro, red salsa, chopped onions and then a creamy avocado sauce.

Whether you're a tourist, drunk late at night, a poor college student, or just simply looking for a quick and affordable meal. Actually if you're staying at a casino on Tropicana and walking is your means of transportation then.. sorry, sucks to be you, but at least you have Earl of Sandwich at the Planet Hollywood. HOWEVERRR if you're a beast and can walk 4 blocks or so in triple digit heat then you indulge yourself by all means.

Why I love Tacos El Gordo:

1. Corn tortillas that are slightly fried before you get them
2. The asada is cooked when you order it (or at least in my experiences). That deserves a high five.
3. ALL-YOU-CAN-DRINK HORCHATA for $1.40? Don't mind if I do.
4. The spicy pork shawarma (adobada) looking thing, most definitely the star of the establishment. There is a slice of pineapple sitting on top of it, leaking all of its delicious juices into the delicious spicy pork. Plus you get a slice on pineapple added to the taco. 
5. Plenty of meat is given, along with the onions, peppers, and green sauce (I'm not sure if its guacamole or not). 
6. The bathroom is CLEAN! Be honest, you know how most cheap eats don't have the cleanest bathroom.

They also have beef head (Cabeza), beef tongue (lengua), and tripe I believe. No chicken just in case you're wondering. Lastly aside from the tacos they have asada or adobada fries ($10), tortas ($4), and quesadillas ($4). All the essentials to a drunk meal.

It's fast, cheap and good. It's got this interesting set up of 3 different counters all serving up different things on the menu, although some of the menu items repeat. So you really should know what you want to get before you stand in line somewhere. I was sober and had 4 years of high school Spanish and I was still having a hard time figuring out where to stand and what I wanted to order! 

You will see all sorts of people in all sorts of dress, here, a true testament that affordable good food draws the masses. In the 30mins we sat and ate, I saw suited up limo drivers and casino security, folks in medical scrubs, construction workers, migrant workers, families who look like they just came from a quincinera, UNLVers, clubbers....and us tourist from HI in our slippers looking for a proper taco that doesn't cost $4 each.

At any rate this place is so convenient to the strip and my beloved Guardian Angel Cathedral that it will be a steady freddy everytime I'm in the 702. 

Pros:
-Late hours, cheap, good, easy parking, fast service, good lighting, lots of people around, no brainer for a taco fix
-SPICY PORK. Yup...that's the one. 
-One order carne asada fries can seriously feed 4-6 people. Watching them prepare it was ridiculous! Seriously, a mound of meat and cheese about 3 inches high just dumped on an entire fry basket of fries. WTH! 
-There's a parking lot and lot's of open spaces. 

Cons:
-It's ain't fancy and it ain't fragrance free. So you will walk into a place where smoke from meat being roasted and things being fried is visibly hanging in the air.

The place is packed on sat night but was quite quiet on friday. I've never had this place in the california area but only heard good things about it.

Definitely not the most healthiest place to eat at but a good price for tasty food. (think the pork fat / oil is used to cook the tacos hence the taste. It was actually a lot smaller than I thought just from looking at the pictures but 4-5 of them filled me out. 

Seems the adobada is most popular. There are multiple lines as well for what you want to order. There are 2 sets of these lines if they are opened. Also it seems if you line up for one you can still order from the line next to you and skip the line (someone can correct me if I am wrong). I just saw people doing it which seemed to be locals.

I'm surprised this place is quite slow though. The wait for adobada took 30 minutes, atleast.

TEG is just past the edge of  'Turisto Vegas' and firmly planted in the 'Residents' Vega's (all the surrounding store-fronts seem to Hispanic, or Korean, or Lebanese- oriented.)
 If you love tacos, then this place is for you.  A little confusing at first, there were snaking lines of Mexicans and Haole all queued up inside the door, for different ordering stations, where incredibly speedy preparers hammer out the variety meats for the tacos and tostadas. After you pick up your order, you take your tray, pay the cashier lady at the front door, and then take your tray outside to a canvas & mylar tent, and grab a seat on a picnic-style bench.  I skipped the more authentic organ-based lines (tripas, cabezas, sesas, etc.) and  just went for an assortment of tacos in my comfort zone: carne asada; lengua; chorizo; adobada.   All were hot, a little greasy, and served on these great little thick, 4"" diameter Masa tortillas, with lime wedges, and nice crunchy radishes.  Delicioso!   I'd probably give the place  5 ***** -- if they could only serve a nice, cold beer ( I settled for an icy can of Coke, which was a good choice for the chiles!)  Skip the flan, which is the standard Industrial article, a thick gluey disc that is squirted into those little plastic cups.

The place is located next to the wynn, and parking is never hard to find as they most of the customers that come walk in from the strip. The interior of the place is surprising clean. The place also offers inside and outside seating, more than likely you'll eat inside cause it's either boiling hot or goosebumps cold outside.

Ordering the food was confusing at first only because you're greeted by the register as you come in. But just go up to any of the workers, order, go back to the cashier, and feast on your food. The prep time for food is miniscule only time you would have to wait is if you order fries.

From your first bite you can tell the quality of the food is far beyond any regular ole taco place. The sauce & adobado just go so damn well together. But to me the main star of this place are their adobado fries. THAT THING IS SERIOUSLY PACKED. Guac overload!!!!! The fries crispy, the cheese cheesy, the sour cream & guac perfect amount, and the avocado on top? Equivalent to a cherry on a ice cream. 

Personally the price of the taco's a ripoff. But the price for the fries a steal.

PRO TIP! You can call ahead of time and order so you don't have to wait in the long lines!

We would stop at this taco stand named Tacos El Gordo. It was some of the best tacos I have ever had. And my first time having a mula (it's like a small sandwich of tortillas with cheese, guacamole salsa and choice of meat). I always wanted them to be in the states. 

I came to Vegas a few years ago and I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd, I can't believe my eyes! Tacos El Gordo! I immediately stopped and ordered my tacos.  Wow! Tasted the same as the small stand in Mexico! And they hand make their tortillas. 

It's in a small plaza passing the Encore. Parking is sufficient. Outdoor and indoor eating areas. You have to order first and then pay. Your wait is a while, but well worth it! You have to stop here and eat!, Long lines but worth it. Different lines for Carne asada,  Al pastor and others!

Mix the Tripa taco with a nice Al Pastor and Carne Asada and you're good to go.  All the tacos here pack some real flavor, and to me is considered the closest thing to really good Mexican food in all of Las Vegas.

He said that the Cashier told him that we did not pay for our food. We showed all of our receipts and the officer was apologetic. No one else in the restaurant that night was asked to show their receipt. Why were we targeted?

My gf mentioned this place so we decided to check it out on Sunday before we headed back to LA. Parking is pretty big and the line was even bigger. Menu is pretty simple. Interesting was that the line forms in 4- 5 different sections. If you want pork then there's a line section just for pork, And same for beef and so on. It can get a little hectic and kind of sucks because you have to keep getting in different lines just to get a  few things. The pork line was pretty fast, my gf waited in the beef line for at least 30 min or more. 

_Taco de Adobadas (spicy pork taco $2.00) the most popular and the BEST! They slice the pork real thin right in front of you. The pork isn't too spicy but just enough flavor. The green sauce gives it a nice little kick and sweetness. Add some lime on top and it's the perfect bite. I could have had 3 of these.. oops already happened!
_Taco de Asada. (steak taco $2.00) I'm never a huge fan of beef taco because normally the beef comes out dry, But I thought this place may be different. Turns out I was right. The beef was a bit dry and after eating the pork taco the beef just did not cut it for me. I wish they added more guacamole sauce.
_Taco de Suadero (beef shoulder $2.00) The beef shoulder was a bit juicier than the steak taco.  I would pick this over the Asada but still the Pork is the best!
_Carne Asada fries ($10) huge portion. We shared this with myself and 3 other girls. It can get quite heavy and rich but so hard to put the fork down. I would do the Adobadas fries instead. 
_Adobadas Tostada. ($2.00) This was pretty good. The crunch factor from the tortilla was nice and the pork was again amazing! 

I would come here again just for the spicy pork taco and would like to try their sopes.

We open the door and the first thing to hit us is the smoke. Immediately following was the smell. When you walk inside it's like you are walking into the grill itself. If they have a ventilation system you'd never know it. So be prepared, you will smell like meat when you leave.

The first thing you need to figure out is which line to stand in. If you want more than one kind of taco be prepared to stand in two lines because you can't stand in the carne asada line and order the al pastor tacos. I recommend you divide and conquer. I waited for the asada and my boyfriend went for the al pastor. But mind you, these lines are long and slow so even if you split up you'll both be waiting a while. 

Luckily, the wait is worth it. After we acquired our tacos, we paid, and went outside to find a table. Fortunately, someone was getting up to leave so we snagged a spot. (oh yeah, the tables are as hard to get as the tacos) We quickly devoured everything. The tortillas are fresh, the meat is seasoned and prepared perfectly and the salsa is a great complement.

There are five seperate lines that lead to a counter where different workers are making food with different types of meat.  The lines are usually out the door so you have to try and stand in the line with the type of meat you plan on ordering and then when you actually get to the front to order you can ask the worker to get you food from the other workers with the different meats down the line.  It gets really hectic because the restaurant gets so packed that there is literally 40 people in a very small space in front of the food counter.  If you are claustrophobic this place will freak you out.  You pretty much feel like a sardine in a can.  

The best meat that Tacos El Gordo has available is the ADOBADA (spicy marinated pork meat) that cooked rotating on a spit.  The worker will slice the meat directly into the taco tortilla and add on all the toppings you desire.  The Adobada is a little spicy so if you cannot handle a little heat this might not be for you.  

Tacos El Gordo is right off of the strip so its really easy to find.  Parking can be a little difficult at times because it just gets so crowded on the strip., nan",4.37,Tony,233,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

We were stuck in 1 line only to realize when we got to the counter that we could only order Al Pastor and Adobada in that line.  If you wanted anything else from their menu like Chorizo, lengua, quesadillas or carne asada fries, you had to line up at 1 of the 3 other lines!!!  Ridiculous!!!  It took me 20mins to get my order of 2 Al Pastor vampiros in my line and as much as I wanted to try the other stuff, I didn't wanna line up again, especially since I arrived the lines were even longer!  After you got your oders, you had to pay at the cashier, then squeeze to the beverage counters.  Dear Tacos El Gordo owners, obviously your stuff is good and people are willing to line up for it, but I really wish you would care more about customer service!  I wish you would implement an effective process where it's first come, first served, order what you want, get it then pay!  We are not herds of cows wanting to eat, we are PEOPLE folks!

Moral of the story, come at an odd hour or come prepared... in a group of 5 people - 1 to save a table, 4 to order at each line/counter so all of yous can get what you want.  Or you can check out their other outlet at E Charleston Rd which may be less crowded.  

All we had was the Al Pastor vampiros and the flan.  The flan was good, but I have a personal preference of the Philippine leche flan over the Mexican version.  This version is more dense, but still yummy and creamy.  For those who haven't tried Vampiros, try it!  It's a taco meets grilled cheese sandwich.  It's all your taco fillings sandwiched between tortillas and grilled so that the cheese melts and packs all the goodness inside.  The Al Pastor meat was exceptional, one of, if not the best I've tried in Vegas.  Very tender and tasty, the right amount of sweet and spices.  The cheese was melted and yummy but the tortilla they used was so thin that most of it was pretty burnt.  I preferred the tortilla they use in Taco y Taco vampiros.  We definitely have to go back for the other items on the menu!

Finally, on our last day in Vegas, we decided to eat at this spot. Looking at the menu, I had decided that I wanted the al pastor tacos, my friend went with it and wanted the same. The kids got quesadillas and french fries. While trying to figure out what I wanted to eat, I realized that you have to stand in the the right line for the type of meat you want. I was able to order the quesadillas and french fries with the guy once I got there.

Each order comes with a plate with hot peppers and green onion. Really notches up the spice. Limes and horseradish sides by the pop and straws. My favorites were the steak and spicy pork. Beef shoulder wasn't nearly as good...a little more dry.

Each comes with guac, usually a condiment specific to the taco you get, onion, cilantro. 

If you want to really treat yourself, arrive when they open at 1030 AM and get the steak fresh to order. Great to have an alternative to the over-priced/under-valued food options on the strip.

Highly recommend!, nan",3.41,Kent,493,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

I was inspired to go here by the great reviews but we have had much better here in Atlanta.  The ordering process was so disorganized.  You go in and the cooks ask you what you want.  Then, you have to go to the cashier in a separate area and tell her what you ordered.  The people behind the counter forgot a couple of things we asked for. We ordered steak quesadillas and an assortment of tacos. The meat itself was good.  However, I could not taste any cheese in the quesadillas.  Also, you have to ask for salsa instead of it being included in the salsa bar most mexican fast food places have.  The salsas also were not very good.  No heat and lacked flavor.  Almost any mexican will tell you that it's the salsas that make or break a taco.

The location is in a strip mall in one of the ""dodgier"" sections of vegas. There was lots of families eating there, so i felt safe. However, I did feel like I had to order all my food in spanish, because everyone there spoke spanish! Unfortunately at the time, I was getting my spanish and german confused.... so that was difficult.

I got two adobada tacos and two asada tacos. I also got a can of fanta. It was about $10 for all this food. It was all incredibly delicious. Someone had commented that it tasted packaged- well, all guacamole consists of is mashed avocados with some other stuff like peppers and garlic, so most guacamole is pretty much the same.

I definitely preferred the adobada tacos. I felt like they were more flavorful. Plus, the first thing you see when you walk in is a thousand layers of pork, on a spit. It sort of calls out to you ; ) Oh, and I""m pretty sure their tortillas are homemade. no store bought stale tortillas here : )

really delicious, very authentic, I think most people will enjoy this place, unless you're used to your mexican food being somewhat fancier and covered in cheese and sauces. If you don't like authentic mexican fare, then i'd skip this place. Also, I stopped by on a saturday afternoon and it was quite crowded. I'm lucky to have found a table.

I am practically beside myself with joy knowing that I can get tacos this good outside of LA. This is the real deal, with a Tijuana pedigree, and it's wholly unlike anything Americans have been trained to expect from a taqueria.

But the first time you see that adobada roasting on a spit topped with a large chunk of pineapple... You know this is different.

You walk up to the meat you want to order, which is a little odd and not entirely convenient but I suppose charming in its own way.

I had the adobada, served with a slice of pineapple, avocado crema and onions and cilantro, a perfect flavor profile; the carne asada is topped with chunky, fresh, bright green guacamole and pico de gallo, a less exotic but equally tempting presentation.

The asada is cooked right in front of you. The adobada is sliced to order. The tortillas are formed and cooked seconds before the meat is piled on. It couldn't get any fresher.

And along with your tacos, you get a big pile of grilled jalapeños and ceballitos (roasted green onions), making this an even better value - I can't believe that all of is goodness is just $2 a taco. On the Strip no less.

To the point where I've started calling myself a ""tacotarian."" (And yes, I know they make fish tacos, I just don't care.)

So on my latest trip to Tacos El Gordo, I decided to branch out and try their vegetarian option - to see if I could keep visiting my favorite Vegas taco joint even in the absence of meat.

The taco azteca (nopales asado) is strips of grilled cactus served on your choice of corn or flour tortilla with salsa and guacamole. The cactus really had a nice snap when you bite into it and a bit of a peppery flavor. A lot of times with vegetarian options for Mexican it feels like you're ""missing"" something. A vegetarian burrito from Chipotle feels like a magic trick sometimes. And not in a good way.

But this was legit. If I ever pull the trigger and go full-on vegetarian, this will be a staple of my diet.

I haven't had TJ style tacos since probably 2001 and that's a long freaking time! Born and raised in LA with frequent trips to Mexico all throughout childhood and well into adulthood, borderline/street tacos was our breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack. So it's only natural that this place is what hits home!

Super cheap tacos and aguas frescas to wash it all down; I was in heaven. You can get full with $20 as tacos are $2 each! We ordered 6 tacos; 4 de carne asada, 1 de lengua, and 1 de sesos. Lime wedges as well as radish slices were available to complete your meal. No long lines, fast service, ample seating indoors and outdoors, and music playing while you eat!

I decided to finally give it a try. They said delicious and huge stuffed tacos. Cool, im a taco kind of guy. You walk in it a normal place. Old style fast food kind of place. The menu is basic, tacos with different kinds of meat. I saw meats I wouldn't touch but knew enough to choose the Carne Asada, Spicy Pork, and Pork Tacos. Staying away from the tongue and other things that are scary and gross tasting to me lol. Anyways, I get my order, pay and get a drink. I should of figured something was up when one of my tacos was covered in foil. I sit down and start on the Carne Asada taco. Pretty decent, mild flavor and hardly any fat. The onions and cilantro was fresh and the salsa was tangy. Cool, Im thinking maybe the spicy pork taco should even be better. It to was decent. Nothing spicy about it. It was more colored pink as an illusion to spicyness I guess. Kinda bland in flavor. Im starting to think that this place isnt as good as my friends said. Especially for the price of a couple bucks per taco. Which are small and not worth the price. They werent even stuff like the name claims lol. I take off the foil to the last taco. Its the Pork Taco so I thought. It was fatty, smelt weird and had greyish chunks in it. the texture looked like some kind of sea creature. I asked an employee is this pork? Not pork tonuge or kidney or some strange animal part, just is this PORK? She said yes. I took a piece of the so called pork and took a small bite. THATS NOT PORK!! If it is, they have some nasty ideas what pork is. I think some health inspectors need to investigate and see what they are selling as Meat, especially the pork.

Tf_jXAn5M-nfhecSYZXrxw,IRYj1b1-mlXqABVsl9SoqQ,2014-05-18,5.0,"My one regret from living in San Diego is that I didn't go to the original Tacos El Gordo in Chula Vista more than once in the three and a half years that I lived there.  Seriously, what I did was practically a crime against humanity.  Because as I mentioned in that review, you're not going to get better tacos anywhere other than Mexico itself.  So when I realized the Gordo opened in Vegas...of course I didn't bother going here either until now LOL.  Yeah, I should just quit on life.

Same deal as the original.  Different meats at different stations, line up and go get some.  If you come here and don't get the adobada, you might as well just get back in your car and drive away.  This adobada is easily some of the best in the world and is the #1 reason to even come here.  Carne asada was just ok in my book, but at least it was prepared with the proper ingredients (aka HELLA GUACAMOLE), so it gets a passing grade in my book.

And since I figured I needed to make up for not coming here who knows how many times, I came for the tacos before going to XS and came for the super fries after going to XS.  Because quite frankly, nothing beats drunk food like drunk Mexican food.  And nothing beats drunk Mexican food like super fries topped with carne asada, adobada, cheese, and guacamole!

I think I have an excuse to go to XS a lot more now.  When the joint is across the street from Encore Las Vegas, there's really not much choice.  Secret Pizza, you have met your post-clubbing food match!, nan",3.96,Alexander,508,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

Everything was good if not great.  The ordering is a little confusing and one needs to be assertive to get the attention of an expediter.  The only thing that is sadly disappointing is the hot sauce.  They put a a couple of tablespoons on each taco, but if that doesn't suffice then you ask for more at the register.  The reality is don't bother.  It is bland and doesn't do anything for the plates being served.
Adobada was a little on sweet side.  Carne Asada had a nice grilled smell and taste.  Lengua and Cabeza were spot on.  Sesos were a first for me and were quite delicious.

It's a long story on how I found this place, but it involves a rental car, spending $5 on a bottle of water and the Hoover Dam.  Anyway, this place is pretty awesome.  They have a Carne Asada Fries plate that is as big as your head (you can get a smaller version for half the price, but why do that to yourself? they're that good.).  The tacos and quesadillas are also really good.  My friend said the spicy pork tastes like chinese bbq pork and the quesadillas are not the ones that most people are used to.  It's more like a flat taco with a fried tortilla on top.  

The staff here is really friendly too.  The guy making the tacos and cutting pork from the meat slab was having a conversation with almost everyone that came in.

So if you're coming from XS, Tryst, Surrender, Blush, etc. and you're drunk or babysitting a drunk, then you should just walk to this spot.  There's also a good Mediterranean food place and a 24 hour Korean BBQ restaurant in the strip mall, so you have options.

Food looks promising when there's a huge slab of pork rotating on a vertical spit, with a pineapple above it (to tenderize the meat).  It's almost as beautiful as one of the girls working the pole down at Sapphire, but I digress.

$2 a taco made me grimace a little, but a smile broke out after I devoured that spicy pork, with its creamy sauce... what was it, pineapple based?  Idk, but I'm coming back.

The guy working the spit was surprisingly welcoming, and patiently answered my noob questions (""what's the vampiro?"" ""the 'vam-pee-roh,'"" he corrected) despite the line forming behind me.  The lady working the register, unfortunately, seemed annoyed at my very presence.  I suspect the guy gets paid more, and is happy the business seems to be flourishing.

There's a/c inside, so you can escape the Vegas heat.  But if you enjoy the desert climate, then you can also sit on the covered patio.

The asada tacos were pretty good too; the chorizo decent.  Nothing beat the flavor of that spicy pork, so I don't bother wasting precious stomach space with less than the best at that location.

However, no more.... well at least not Tacos Mexico. Anyway, lets just get to the good stuff. 

Tacos el Gordo is amazing place. Hands down the best street taco's ever. Being that they are orginally from Tijuana, they are already off to a good start. Personally I am a huge fan of their carne asada and ablongida (sp.?) tacos. They also have more exotic delights as cabeza (head) lengua (tounge) and a few other goodies I have yet to try. Plus, their cane asada fries are nothing short of amazing in my mind.

I was on the strip over the weekend and figured it was the perfect time. When I walked in I was completely overwhelmed with the various lines of people waiting for tacos. It took me a few minutes of looking around to figure out that there were separate lines for different cuts of meat and that there were 2 counters on either side of the restaurant with the same lines and menu. You're supposed to order your food at the counters and then pay for it at either of the 2 register areas at the front (1 by each door).

After looking at the menu for quite some time I decided to go with 2 al pastor tacos, because you can't go wrong with those, and 1 tripa or tripe taco. The al pastor was tasty, well seasoned and cooked, which made me glad that I got more than 1. The tripa was ok, not what I thought it was and it had an interesting taste to it that I wasn't used to. I also wanted to try the asada fries or adobada fries but will wait until next time because I'm sure it's a humongous portion judging by the price.

Not sure why they have separate lines because the guy that was serving the al pastor told me that I could order everything at 1 station when he saw me standing in another line after getting my tacos from him. How nice of him for worrying about my tacos getting cold while standing in line :)

Seating is difficult if you come during lunch, just don't forget about the outside seating like I did.

I've had really amazing tacos when I travelled throughout D.F. and other parts of Mexico. Probably 9/10 street vendors were bomb, 5 stars, best tacos I've ever had to date. And I've luckily managed to find tacos almost as good in Los Angeles and in vegas (very recently). 

I've given tacos el gordo on Charleston a chance about a year ago, but didn't post my review as I didn't want to get stoned to death. 
I chose to give this new location a second shot for the tacos el gordo experience. 

Carne asada- 2 stars. I prefer some parts of my carne asada to have a char and prefer to have the meat more marinated or seasoned. This place is not my favorite. 

Al pastor- 2 stars. Pretty much for the same reasons, I did not enjoy it much. 

The plain fries for $2.25 were the highlight of my night, though it's probably frozen stuff.

The salsa bar doesn't have green and red sauce, so make sure to ask for it while getting the tacos.

Their al pastor was one of the best things I've had in LV and seeing the Yelp pics of Tacos El Gordo's adobada on the spit posted had me salivating in front of my laptop.  Must. Go. ASAP!

We ordered 4 adobada, 1 carne asada and 1 beef tongue.  We really liked everything except the tongue.  Maybe it was just our mood that day?  I was freaking starving so I was ready for more.  As soon as I'm about to speak to the guy manning the adobada, he grins and asks ""How many more do you want?"".  I'm sure this happens every 10 minutes there.

I got 2 more adobada along with a brain taco.  The guy automatically perked up when I ordered brain.  The person in charge of the internal organ taco dept went to work digging out some to chop up and put in a corn tortilla.  They also assumed it was my first time trying it.  They assumed right!

It wasn't bad although I didn't love it either.  It was like a beef pate with a lobstery taste to it.  Not ready to order another the next day but we're glad we tried one.

Let's talk about the tacos.  Oh the tacos.  We ordered the Carne Asada and El Pastor.  The Carne Asada comes with the usual onions and cilantro.  Get the avocado sauce...on everything.  It is amazing.  The El Pastor was cut off of a huge stack of meat roasting on a spit.  Then it gets covered in a red sauce and the avocado sauce and topped with onions and cilantro.  Meat is tender and well seasoned.  AMAZING.  

Yes, it's crowded, but that's a good sign.  If you have to sit on a curb, stand outside, or stand on your head to eat your food...do it.  The prices are great and you can get a drink with free refills.  Tacos El Gordo is truly a gem in an area where prices are ridiculously expensive, the price for one taco is about $2.

Went here around 9:30pm on a Thursday night and it was effing packed.  I knew it was a good sign when I saw a ton of Mexicans and a security guard packing a real gun.  Tacos are serious business!

I ordered 3 tacos.  I got the Adobada (spicy pork), lengua (tongue) and carne asada tacos.  All 3 tacos were very good, though I was probably the most disappointed with the adobada.  It wasn't that it wasn't good, but there just wasn't a lot of meat in the taco.  The meat that was in there was good, but that particular taco looked a little sad.  I did enjoy the free guac topping on the carne asada taco.  The lengua was cooked very well done and I thoroughly enjoyed that taco as well.

I was so happy to discover that this place was walking distance from where I was staying.  There was a long line, but we knew it was going to be so. worth. it. 

Upon reaching the entrance, you'll find that there are three lines inside for different tacos.  
     1. Carne Asada and Chorizo 
     2. Adobada
     3. All the other stuff
This can get kind of problematic if you want a few tacos from each of the lines, but I'm guessing that this was the most efficient way to move things along.  Try to get your friends in the other lines to order the tacos for you!

I tried the Lengua ($2.25), Tripa ($2.00), and Adobada ($2.00) tacos.  The lengua taco (aka tongue for you gringos) was SO tender and juicy.  Tripa (tripe) was kind of a  weird texture for me.  I don't think that crunchy goes well in tacos, but some might say otherwise! Adobada was my personal favorite.  That green sauce they put on it is delicious.

You may or may not pass it the first time but once you pass Wynn, and the little overpass (desert inn), there is a parking lot that leads to a Church . You can either park here (before Tacos el Gordo) or park in the lot after passing the restaurant. The restaurant itself faces Las Vegas Blvd, so not hard to spot it if you are looking for it.

Unlike the Charleston location, this location also has outdoor seating. Something different from the other location as well, they have double the amount of lines, but as you can probably guess.... this location can be MUCH MUCH busier. But if you want tongue/stomach, i think there is only ONE line for that (far right off to the side). 

First time i came here, mid day, not really busy at all. Later few times, were in the evening, SUPER PACKED ! ! You'd think there was some sale or something ! 

Some people say the quality of their stuff is less than of the Charleston location. Meat quality, i think is the same. If you were to order fries, i've had varying experiences with that. Sometimes fresh out of the fryer, sometimes not. 

My favorites to get is beef tongue, pork stomach. Super flavorful and something you usually dont get at your chain store Taco Bell (rarely go fast food anyway, esp not Taco Bell)

Good idea, if you are going with other people... is if you want different meats, have each person be in different lines and get the order. Otherwise, you'll be in line for a long long time... 

Surprisingly, even the outdoor seating, there is always someone cleaning up. Great service ! Not like that was something i was looking for anyway, but it was a plus ! A lot of times, while sitting there after eating, and just talking, they'd come up and help us take our trays and trash away.

After a loooong night at XS,  we were too hungry to even think about sleep.  Generally, we'd hit up Earl's, Grand Lux, Ellis Island, or any other 24/7 places around the strip.  This time around, a friend from UNLV told us we gotta try this tacos place out.  There was no way I could've refused since tacos are one of my favorites and we figured... gotta trust the locals!

After a short drive, and it really is a short drive from Wynn properties, we were there and it was still packed at 5am.  Two lines, one for adobado and one for everything else.  The reason there's a line for the adobado is that the spicy pork is cooked on a vertical rotating spit, just like how it would be in Mexico!  The pork is shaved directly onto fresh warm tortilla, then they add all the toppings for the tacos: lime green cream sauce, salsa, onions & cilantro.

The spicy pork has a ton of flavor and the cream sauce just works so well with the salsa and the pork.  Oh!  Also, if you look closely you'll see a chunk of pineapple at the top of the vertical spit.  You can actually request to have pina in your taco!  Definitely wouldn't have known if it wasn't for our friend and that sweet warm pineapple in the taco was definitely what makes this taco one of the best I've ever had! 

We also shared some carne asada fries.  I've lived in San Diego for a few years and I have yet to find carne asada fries comparable to the ones I've had in SD.  Tacos El Gordo's fries do come close though!  Fries are covered with carne asada, shredded cheese, and the same lime green sauce with a few dollops of guac!  Heavy, yes, but very much needed after 6+ hours at XS :P

We stopped in during lunch on a Saturday, and it wasn't busy at all. We ordered the campechana fries - comes with both carne asada and spicy pork. 

It is a bit confusing about how/where to order, seems like that problem could be solved with just a couple signs over the ordering lines?? We must have looked confused cause one of the employees came over and told us what each line is for, and when we told her we were just wanting the fries she stepped up and ordered for us. They then told us to go have a seat and they would bring our order out since it would take a few minutes. 5 stars for the great service!

We only tried the fries, and you definitely get a lot. I would say they are worth the $10 price. Not the best ones we've ever had, but still really good. They top them with cheese, sour cream, what looked like an avocado sauce as well as guacamole. I think they would have been really great though  if they had a selection of salas to top them with, it seemed odd to us that a taco shop wouldn't have that, and honestly the fries were missing it.

Anyways, if you have never been, one word : ADOBADA.  Adobada is a marinated pork awesomeness that is fire grilled on a rotisserie like setup.  This is why this place is awesome, so if you come here, you owe it to yourself to try it.  Try it MULAS style, which is essentially a taco, but with another tortilla on top with cheese in the middle...quesadilla style.  Try it on the fries...can't go wrong....it is awesome.

Besides that, I have tried some of the others...the beef head and regular asada is great, but it doesn't shine a light to the adobada imo.

Besides the flavor, you can't beat the price.  Tacos start at $2, and although you will need a few to fill you up, I find it difficult to believe you will find anything this good to eat 24-7 especially on the strip.

They just expanded, so it is much easier to find a seat and the lines are shorter...but still be prepared to wait a bit to order.

Almost no line on a Saturday night!  At least compared to before....only took me a few minutes to get all my food!  Plus it is much easier to find a seat now, since they pretty much doubled that too.

And don't take that as a bad sign...still very full and busy overall, but without the ""bad"" busy of having to wait before you can eat!

Still wish they made their horchata scratch like in TJ!

Ask for a small portion because they are still huge and are plenty big enough to share!

$5 is the entry price.  Adobada/Al Pastor is the best thing ever in case you didn't know already!  Slightly spicy marinated pork with all the goodies!

Just north of Encore on Las Vegas Blvd, it was a cheap $6 cab fare from The Mirage, (ten minute walk back afterwards) The Tacos were out of this world fresh. Meat sliced right into the tortilla from the spinning rotisserie of spicy pork or beef. Topped with fresh homemade salsas, cilantro and onion. The small but comfortable outdoor patio was perfect for the sunny day. We only wish we had gone sooner, not on our last day before heading home! Delicious, and only $2 a taco is a steal so close to the strip. Most delicous and cheapest meal you will find., nan",4.01,Susie,270,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

I have to visit every time I come to vegas and it seems like I always get the same thing. The Adobada tacos (spicy pork). The creamy green sauce makes the taco even more delicious.

I've also had the half order of the carne asada fries. For two people, this is usually plenty because they fill up the half togo box full of fries and they give you a good amount of meat. And what makes it better? THE CREAMY GREEN SAUCE! The fries are crunchy and they come right out of the fryer.

I'm going to keep coming back until this place either disappears or stops making good food (hopefully that never happens) =], nan",4.03,Linda,63,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd

And this place rocked!  The menu is simple - think the taco version of In and Out Burger menu.  Just tacos, fries, and that's pretty much it.   The adobado tacos, $2 each, amazing!  Pork marinated in a red chili sauce with vinegar and oregano.  There is one line for all things abodabo, so make sure you're in the right line.  We also got the abodabo fries - the same pork over fries with a bunch of yummy sauce all over it!  And the half order is HUGE!  The other line is for all other tacos - we also got carne asada tacos.  Those were good too but I'm an abodabo fan!  You can also get a side of grilled veggies.  And then there's a jalapeño, lime, and radish bar... to garnish your tacos.  Salsa is behind the counter where you pay so you have to ask for it.   Definitely a must do when in Las Vegas! The only other place you can experience Tacos El Gordo is in Tijuana., nan",3.8,Lora,498,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Tacos El Gordo,"3049 S Las Vegas Blvd
