I waited over 15 minutes to get a beer while one of the bartenders just stood there talking to someone! The only reason I got a beer was one of the other customers called Ron over. I was asked by Ron "" What do you want?""  I was taken aback by this! The customer that called Ron over said "" Oh that is just Ron""  I ordered a beer and was just handed my change. No thanks no nothing. Ron walked back to where he was standing to talk to the younger customers. That is fine if that is how you want to run a bar. My money is just as good as the next persons. A thank you would have been nice! I was told this bar is busy on sundays for beer bust. If this is how Ron treats the customers I don't think I will be back. From looking at the bar rags this town has alot of bars in it. I am sure there is a bar that will take my money and treat me like a customer and not like someone I would not trick with.

I'd come from a village of 500+ people and was in awe of city living. There I was, in the fifth largest city in the US, living on the same street made notorious by hookers and drug deals. Oddly enough, it was on the corner that I met my BFF, at the bus stop. But there's quite a bit more to that corner--Nu Towne Saloon. 

Back in the early 2000s, Daddy Ron ran the place and it was a den of devilish sins. Cheap beer in a smoke-filled environment called out to the horny, the lonely and the drunks. You could bet that I'd be there every Sunday for their beer busts and a few night during the week. I used to hop the fence in the parking lot to my apartment when I was too drunk to walk all the way around. And if I happened to rub up against you inappropriately back in the day, I'm blaming the dim lighting.

But now, I live in CenPho and rarely venture to my old stomping grounds. However, my BFF and I went to the swap meet at the greyhound track yesterday and I thought it would be therapeutic to drive by our old places and appreciate how our lives have turned out. This trip down memory lane included a visit to Nu Towne. A lot has changed in the past few years. That dirt overflow parking lot to the west of the bar is apartments now, and there's a street that runs along side of that. Daddy Ron is now at the Eagle (cum Retro Bar). Gone is that dark cavernous bar with the beer-sticky floors. Today, Nu Towne has undergone a metamorphosis into a swanky saloon. Natural light brightens the bar through two new windows. And existing window openings have been reclaimed. The restrooms are also bright and clean. The color scheme is decidedly more serene, the truck is gone, two new pool tables replaced to former ones with mystery stains of unknown origins and are spaced on either end of the bar, and flat-panel TVs add another layer of freshness. Although I'm not one to get excited about such things, they even have Wii events. 

So, Nu Towne has transformed from that ""It'll be our little secret"" bar to a ""Yeah, and I don't even cringe when I see my dad here"" bar. Go. Check it out. If you were here before return to see how much it's changed. If you've never been, give it a go. Don't be concerned if the parking lot isn't full--the neighbors at the apartments walk over there and can be found both inside and out of the patio., nan",Bacon,401,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",Nu Towne Saloon,"5002 E Van Buren St

Nu Towne is simple bar with a feeling of a warm inviting ""Cheers"" type place. I mean where on God's green earth does a macho bartender introduce himself when you approach the bar to buy a beer?!!

The decor, although dated, is wonderfully nostalgic. The music, one of the best parts, is both old-school (who plays The Beach Boys?!), and new catchy songs. The clientele is a mix of young-ish, middle age, and mature--all friendly, no-attitude, and inviting. Met the nicest duo (friends/biz partners). I can't remember the last time strangers invited me for a drink and were so down-to-earth. 

Suggestions: close the damn doors. I ""get"" the inviting look of open doors at places of biz, but it was too cold unless one sat in the middle of the place. I don't get why all bars do this. 

Otherwise, I'm a huge fan. Goodbye Charlie's; those of us who loathe drag shows will ""walk on by"" (I'd bet Nu Towne places Dion Warwick every now and then)., nan",Bill,116,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",Nu Towne Saloon,"5002 E Van Buren St

It's a bar so expect to find drinkers, some of them never go home, some go every day, some once a week and some like me that have been enjoying this place for 25 years!
Nutown has always been that friendly place to grab an Ice Cold Beer on the Cheap, It's always been the closest bar to ASU Main, It has always been that place with the best holiday decorations, and yes it's a great place to cruise.

What is NEW at Nu Towne is a bright new refreshed interior, uniform clad ultra freindly bartenders, and a renewed sence of community pride.

It's busy on the weekends especially Sunday afternoons, so if you go on off hours bring your own party or expect to be welcomed into conversation with the regulars and bartenders, shoot some pool, or you might just get cruised

Hungry? It's next to Honey Bears BBQ, The bartenders will fix you a corn dog, and on Sundays enjoy excellent grub on the patio. Great food & prepared to order, things like grilled chicken, steaks, burgers and chili. The procedes from The food goes to local charities and groups.

That about sums up the crowd at BS West - at least on 2-4-1 (yep, two for one drinks all night!) Wednesdays - their busiest night.  I'm not a big fan of this place as the crowd is pretty young and obnoxious -- drawing in my least favorite crowds:  gay ASU guys and the Scottsdale/East Valley gays.

Weekends are a bit more subdued, and might be a better time to check BS out, and on Thursdays and Sunday they do some karaoke.  Gays and karaoke?  Who would have thought.

It can be a very fun time if you go with your friends.  There's a nice loungey room upstairs with couches and a pool table (which I'm sure is fun on other days when it's not so crowded).  The music is dance/top 40 with accompanying MTV videos on the big screens.  It gets very busy, and with the north patio doors flung open, it can get downright STEAMY (and not in a good way) in there.

Since the renovation about a year ago they enlarged the dance floor, the unisex bathrooms are larger and much nicer and they added a south patio.  But it's still packed as ever as this is the only gay bar in Scottsdale, the closest gay bar to ASU and the closest one to Mesa.

Like others have mentioned, the drinks are strong and the bartenders are really nice. I usually copy what my friends get to drink since I'm not yet an avid alcoholic, so when I asked one of the bartenders upstairs what he recommended, he steered me in the right direction to Tokyo Teas which I absolutely adore. 

The DJ on Thurs. is typically this ""older"" gent who plays weird remixes, but tonight the DJ was younger and pretty crackin'.

No, I do not currently live in Scottsdale (or Arizona for that matter).
Yes, I think this place is a solid 4-stars!

Let me explain what's amazing about this place in reference to the bars in San Francisco: 

1. 2 for 1 drinks Wednesday and Saturdays ALL NIGHT. Yea, shut the loose hole! This is an amazing deal! Our happy hour specials are 2-4-1 until 8 or 9, if we're lucky! 

2. You know all the boys will either be here or only 2 other places on any given night. I actually think it sucks wet pussy to have to navigate 10-20 bars just to find fresh meat. (not that I ever do... but it's the principle of the thing).

3. Service is actually amazing! Drinks come to you! The bar tenders make 'em strong (especially the gal towards the smoking patio). 

4. 2 smoking patios?! NOICE. Many bars in SF require you to go outside!.. it just becomes a pain.

5. They accept card. In the event you didn't know this, many places in SF don't.... 

You may be a local and hate this place for what it is, but for someone who spends extended amount of time in the area every so often, I find it a great place to be near fagily (fag family)., nan",Andrew,302,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

My bf's bachelorette party was held here after dinner and, at first, I was a little bit worried I'd experience the same crap as Axis/Radius for my last friend's bachelorette party (I was hard of hearing for the next full day and the crowd was so lame, I just wanted to sit on the side and count how many girls looked like 'ladies of the night') but to my pleasant surprise, this place totally impressed me!  Here is why:

Disclaimer: I am a happily married straight gal, LOVE to dance techno
1- the crowd was 80% gay men, which was perfect since it meant I wasn't going to get dumb guys trying to hit on me (hello! don't you see my shiny ring AND the fact that I'm NOT dressed like a 'lady of the night' trying to get your attention) or trying to literally pull me away from my friends to dance (freak) with them.

2- the gals that were there were gay/tran/etc and not the prostitute-looking, dumb 'barely dressed' broads (as typical of lots of Scottsdale clubs) you have to deal with that take up room on the dance floor and aren't even dancing (they're just standing there trying to look hot).

3- the bartender dudes were awesome - friendly, generous with the many shots we bought and I NEVER had to 'wait' for the bartender or try to get his attention - they were very attentive and actually friendly!  ALSO, their drinks were strong! not watered down.

4- the atmosphere is fun - the place is a bit dark and dive-y looking inside (and out), but once you get the music going and the crowd thickens up, it is fun!  Also, a major thing to me - the music was perfectly amplified such that my ears were not ringing even though I was on the dance floor all night.  Also the club patrons were not like the A/R patrons.. friendlier, fun to dance with, cuter boys!  Also, since it was a bachelorette party, a lot of the gay men there were kind enough to buy the bride plenty of drinks and even take her out for plenty of dancing.

5- the owner came by and offered our bride-to-be an oh-so-sexy dance with 2 of the better looking go-go dancer dudes (I thought that was cool of the owner to set up).

I don't even club but I'd say that if I am ever invited to go clubbing again in Scottsdale, I am all for visiting this gay club!

Acme had about a handful of people (it was already 11!), however, you could hear people talking and laughing and there we found the crowds of people in this hidden building, drinking and dancing.

They still had their 2 for 1 drink chips and their go-go dancers. There was line, as usual, but I found it slow moving. And no, it's not cause there was a swarm of people filling the inside to capacity. I actually don't know why it was slow moving cause it was pretty empty for a Saturday night inside. I mean, yes, there were people out on the patios, but not that many where if they all were forced inside, would fill the place to capacity. The DJ last night I found was kind of lacking; I wanted to dance but the songs weren't really anything worth dancing to, but I do like the fact that they always take request, which leads me to another gripe. 

They changed their layout which is not really all that great. Now, I don't know if that was just for the night, but if it's not, well it's horrible. Yes, there's room and flow towards the bar but placing a dancer's platform right in front of the DJ, who takes requests, is so stupid. STUPID! I can't say it enough, considering they won't let people up there! I get not letting people go up there to dance, but not letting people up there to talk to the DJ is stupid. I'm short so I'm SOL in general in trying to talk to the DJ but my friend is taller and would be able to talk to the DJ, if the stage weren't there. And it's not like there was a dancer currently on there.

Place is still a good place to go out to and drink since they have 2 for 1's but I think it'll take more than that if I'm going to spend the whole night there.

Just to clarify, I'm not a gay hater or phobic or whatever in any way. This was written tongue-in-cheek. I've actually been to BS West quite a few times - my feelings about it are that it's kinda lame for a gay scene. I've seen better. It's a decent little bar though in its own right. Anyway - here's my blog as it appeared:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So last weekend was apparently 'Gay Weekend' - it was purely unintentional though.  Accidental gayness to be sure.
 
I was hanging out on Friday with my straight lesbian friend (she insists she's straight and that her girlfriend is as well - either way it gives me 'the hot,' so I don't question it) trying to show her around the cool parts of town so she doesn't decide to move pack it up and move away.  She lives in the worst and most isolated ghetto in the valley.  After moving here from a much cooler city and state, she's ready to get the fuck out of here after less than a year.  I can't really blame her.
 
Anyway - we were in downtown Scottsdale walking around and we had parked in a parking garage that was next to this tucked away gay bar called BS West.  I asked her if she wanted to go there since it was 'her people' and she did, so we did.  The first person we saw was a crossdresser (I'll get to that in a bit), and when we walked in - she made a beeline for the bathroom.  I followed and hung out near the door with my back facing the wall - trying to act casual while avoiding surprise anal rape attack.
 
She 'came out' and we got ourselves a drink and found a quiet observer spot outside so we could spy on the gays in their natural habitat.  It was mostly dudes in this place - almost no lesbians.  The guys at this place ranged from nearly middle-aged guys in hawaiian shirts, shorts and sandals to skinny young emo pretty boys. 
 
The drinks were pretty stiff, but the atmosphere was dead, so we headed out after one drink.  We accidently opened the door to a freezer or storage room instead of finding the exit... I think we were both concentrating on not getting surprise attack analy raped.  The rest of the night went on without incident.  At one point we were invited to this club called Burn in Phoenix by this girl who showed me where BS West was in the first place when I tagged along with her and the fags to her hag.  We respectfully declined, but made a mental note of the fact that we were 'missing out' on all the hot sexy single ladies.

New content: 

With regard to the mention of that first visit to BS West - it was pretty amusing actually... this was ages ago... but the first time I had met with my friend's gay pals was this night - my first visit to BS West - and we got out of the car and started towards BS West. I thought we were headed to Loco Patron where I had previously had a horrible experience and I said ""oh, fuck this - I'm not going here!"" and got all viciously adamant about it.

My friend's gay friends went through a spectrum of emotion ranging from confusion, curiosity, intolerance, and disgust. They thought I didn't want to go to BS West because it was a gay bar and that I was a horrible asshole. Once near the door and inside, I realized my mistake and spent the next half hour feeling like a shit heel and saying my sorries. I don't think I ever fully recovered from that first impression, but I'm friends with one of those guys now at least., nan",Max,402,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

For starters, the night we went (about 2 months ago) there was a $12 cover per person and there wasn't even any live music or entertainment. I still don't know what the cover was for... The bar was filthy and totally outdated, the staff were not friendly and the overall vibe was blah. 

We arrived and ordered a round of drinks. As we were sitting outside on the patio, one of the bar staff came up to our table to clear our empty drinks and mistakenly took a drink that was half full. I said something to him and about 5 minutes later the ""bar manager"" came out and asked us all to leave. We were upset and confused. Once we were outside she told us that she thought we were on ""high on drugs"" (which we weren't) and said we are not welcome back for the night. I called the next day and left a message for the owner and never got a call back to this day. Highly, highly embarrassed and disappointed. 

We went back about two weeks ago and decided to give it another shot and we still were not impressed at all. I would absolutely NOT recommend going here.

Our cocktail server was extremely efficient and attentive; it was top-notch service, especially for a busy weekend night. The drinks were a little weak, but they were on the larger side and not too expensive. One of the people in our group complained that his double Patron shots were really small and he was right. For $18 or so a pop, those shots should have been more than generous singles. 

I loved the layout of the place, the variety of seating (high tables to stand around, high bars with stools, lower tables with chairs), and the clean bathrooms. The biggest disappointment of our short time there was not getting to sing karaoke, which was going at full blast when we arrived. My husband and I each put a song in as soon as we arrived, but after 45 minutes (when everyone in our group was tired and waiting to go home), we still hadn't gotten called. I don't like when KJs don't go out of their way to welcome new singers and to insert them into the existing rotation, especially since we heard the same people sing two times in the time we were waiting to sing once. On the upside, the song list was good, the singers were above-average, and I liked the little space they had for singers to stand (eat your heart out, Apollo's!). 

Since we live pretty far from here, I probably won't be back. I'd rather spend my karaoke budget at Kobalt or Apollos.

I first ventured to BS West for a massive birthday party and just in time to catch their drag show on a Friday or Saturday night.  From the outside it looks huge, but once you get inside don't be afraid of a little body rubbing.  The queens put on a great show and afterwards they had some heavenly looking man meat for go-go dancers take the floor in tight banana huggers. (Was that graphic enough?)

There are random TV screens strewn about upstairs and downstairs with a video going along with the music, typical.  I could say that the music selection was a little drab.  I like just a little more house and a little less Top 40 hip/hop remix.  The bartenders are quick to get your order.  The drinks aren't the strongest, but the price won't break your wallet.  That's always nice.

This was my first time at a Phoenix gay bar so I was excited to see what it was like. It's located in a strip mall in Old Town, which was a little surprising. I paid $5 cover and $6 for 2-4-1 Vodka Cranberries. You buy one drink and then you get a token to use later on that night. The drinks were strong and cheap - my favorite combo.

Overall, a lot of fun dance music and some hip hop, three go go dancers, and a small-medium dance floor and a ""patio"" outside. It was a fun time and I would likely return.

There was only one issue:

BEWARE!
I didn't find out about this until after we had left, but my friend charged the drink ($6) she bought on her credit card. She was told there was a $2 service charge. When she got home, she saw that she had been charged a total of $10. Since she said she did not tip - which I personally do not agree with - she didn't understand where the extra $2 charge came from. Now, I personally always tip when I buy drinks, even when it's 2-4-1 night and the second drink is technically free - I still tip on both drinks. However, I still don't think it was right for the bartender to tip himself, because that is technically committing fraud. Incredibly wrong and illegal. I am so glad I did not use my credit card and I would NEVER use my card here after that incident., nan",Heather,283,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

For those of you who have read my reviews...know that I drink Long Island Tea and use that as a test if they do it well.  Well, I was disappointed.  I'm supposed to have a buzz before I even finish my first LIT.  After 2 LIT, no buzz.  Just give me water, honey.

However, I didn't go there to get drunk.  Hung out with a couple of friends.  Checked out the guys that were eyeing us and of course, we were gossiping like the hens we are.  Checked out the dancers.  Am I getting old or are the dancers getting younger?  B-itch!   Maybe I should've had a third LIT.

BTW, if you're a smoker and you've run out of cigarettes, just go to the bar and buy a pack.  I'm not sure if it applies to the entire state, but Phoenix and Scottsdale are smoke-free so you'll have to smoke outside.  BS has an enclosed patio for you to hang out.

I was initially concerned about keeping up with all the beautiful people of Scottsdale.  First impressions, I found it to be a little difficult to find, -sort of behind the parking garage, down an alley.  Although I'd read there was no cover charge, in fact there was one, $3.  Once inside I found it to be a quaint bar, not too many places for a stand and pose, it had good flow and a small outside patio for the smokers.  It has an upstairs loft space which I found to be a bit of a dead space; maybe best served for hanging out with a group of friends if you are not interested in the mingle.  It was 2-4-1 drinks.  I was buying; my friend had a beer and I had a mixed drink.  I was handed two different colored poker chips, (yellow and red.)  I should have asked if there was a difference.  I found out later, after having to buy a another drink, one represented beer and another mixed drinks.  Probably a no-brain-er, but I was too busy trying to figure out what BS stood for. 
 
The dance floor started to pick up.  They were playing dance videos on large screen televisions.  The music was not particularly hot, but it did get boys grooving.  It was a playfull, silly evening -just what I like when I'm going out; not taking it too seriously.

My first introduction to BS West was a long time ago... well long to me... back in 2005. I had been to Charlie's, and at one time there was Crowbar which is now Club Downtown. Also had been to Boom! But never heard of BS West until someone mentioned on facebook group of a gay club hidden behind Acme in Old Town. They described it as the gay club down the alley that it was hidden that anyone could easily miss it. So I went with two friends and based on pure curiousty, walked down the alley next to Acme and saw a door (pre-patio days) with a sign above it that said BS West. It was a Sat. and it wasn't too crowded but we were in awe... it was true there was an actual gay bar near Tempe. And that's how I was introduced to the 2-4-1 drink specials and the BS West chips. 

This video bar of which I think is its only kind in Phoenix and really haven't found any other video bars in other gay havens is such a nifty idea. I mean, haven't you ever been in a club and just didn't want to dance but the song is so good, that you gotta do something? well the video bar concept is awesome in that you can drink and watch the music video and kinda dance along... LOVE IT! You can never beat the drink specials here on Wed. which has always been 2-4-1 and Sat nights too. Both nights are crazy packed... that I'm sure it's against fire code but there's no restrictions... just a mass of gay men, and all kinds too, intermingle some queer peers too and it's just a great environment! Strong drinks too. But what I love apart from the drink specials are the poker chips which you can use as currency in the future. Certain colors mean certain drinks like cocktails, shots and the like. The Dj usually plays a good mix but depends who's there and if there having an off night but if you want a good time, strong drinks, and just a packed atmosphere... check out BS West or BS!, nan",Jason,229,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

BS is really only busy on Wednesdays when they have their 2-for-1 drink special all night. Then, it's packed. Wall to wall. Unfortunately, the drinks aren't so great.

The entire experience with BS West was.. well BS.  I think the easiest way to explain my frustration is just bullet points, otherwise I'll get carried away... 
*Parking - A freaking mess. 
*Staff - Rude as crap. 
*Capacity - I understand wanting to make money off the cover.. but having wayyyy too many people inside there is not fun, and also just not safe, they HAD to be over capacity the night I went. 
*Customers - ugh. Suburban Hell.  It was cute annoying little twinks, their very annoying str8 girlfriends, and some awkward housewives who stumbled in on the way home from Applebees. 

All in all, I guess this would be an ideal club for someone who's... 18-22.  A twink would love this place, but I've apparently passed over that point in life.. I like my gay bars alittle grittier, the biggest issue was the shopping mall feel for me., nan",Will,122,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

The staff is super cute but don't expect them to remember who you are or what you ordered. 

Be careful with the eye contact, boys, because this place turns into a real meat market. Guys don't know their boundaries so it's a great place to hook up or show off your hot boyfriend. 

After last night's experience I have a few suggestions for BS- forget the expanded front patio or if they're going to keep it big then invest in port-a-potties, and hire another patio server. At 11:30 I felt claustrophobic and it only got worse from there. Straight, drunk chicks, who think we're remotely interested in what they have to offer, should check out Dos Gringo's next door. It's a gay bar honey, I don't care how nice your chi chi's are. 

It's not that I miss the exclusivity of Old Town's BS West but I miss chatting with friends without people bumping into you, being able to go pee, and wanting to dance. Maybe it was just the wacky 'Heaven & Hell Mardis Gras' themed night (I was confused too) but this has slowly become a common occurrence with this bar and it's rather depressing. The crowd is constantly evolving due to nearby ASU but it's not always a good thing. 

Change is inevitable but BS should check themselves before they wreck themselves (I couldn't think of any other way to state that)., nan",Caleb,18,"['Bars', 'Gay Bars', 'Nightlife']",BS West,"7125 E 5th Ave

And in reality, a lot of straight people go to gay bars these days - it's 2013 people!

With that said, I've gone here both with my LGBT friends as well as my girlfriend. I've also always gone on Wednesdays, which have great drink specials. BSW is a great place to dance and if it so interest you, to check out the muscle-ridden underwear-only go-go dancers.

Drinks are strong. In fact, the very first time I went here within 15 seconds of getting in the gate... one dude puked on another dudes shoe. Neither seemed to care - something of which if that happened in a straight club, you would have got your ass whooped, then thebouncers would have thrown you over the fence. I turned to my gay friend and said, ""you guys sure are wild party animals.""

On Wednesday you buy a drink and they give you chips to spend on drinks later. Gay bars are known for having strong drinks and this place is no different. Any other place in Scottsdale is going to pour you watered down drinks - I know, because I go there too. So needless to say, you get your money's worth here, I feel, on Wednesday.

Parking is mainly in the parking garage, which is pretty plentiful. But if you go later in the night, that garage may be full. But hey, this is better parking than 80% of Oldtown Scottsdale. So get there early, or better yet, cab it there and cab it home.

The last time I was there with my girlfriend and her friends. It was good fun until the end when someone lifted her purse. The friend got a little crazy and upset and blamed us. It is unfortunate that this happened, but I can't nessisarily blame the bar for this act.

I tend to stay away from any place that chips are considered a course in your meal and deep fried is a cooking method. While I still stick to this mothodology, its nice to break pace every few weeks to keep your sanity. I mean, you cant live on veggies for too long without getting a craving for something tasty, meaty, and full of carbs.

Mi Patio was just the spot. We ordered a spinach and cheese chimi and a couple orders of their tacos; chicken and beef. After filling up on chips and chowing down the great tasting tacos, we couldn't even begin to eat the chimi. While my expectations for a next day chimichanga wasn't so high up there, it was actually still good the next day. I imagine that it would have been all the better had I eaten it fresh from the kitchen. Maybe next time ill go light on the chips.

The life of a tortilla is much like anyone else full of glamour, large family drama and constant transformation. I'd like to share that story with you here today, my life as a tortilla.

Ever since being a young kernel of corn I've know I was different from the rest of the ear. While the other kernels longed to be cereal and ethanol, I knew that I wanted to be a star. Celebrated each and every day, giving promise of a brighter and tastier future. Then it happened, I was suddenly plucked, mashed, rolled and pressed, being transformed from the ugly duckling into the beautiful swan I always knew I was. Destined for greatness in the kitchen of Mi Patio, I knew it was all coming true for I am the corn tortilla.

From the second you walk in the door of my home, you can sense my presence. Bold colors, comfortable seating and smiling faces were all there to celebrate my life and times. As soon as you are seated a hot, lightly salty and crispy bowl of me is sat onto the table. They've cut me into triangles so I'm easier to handle, then I'm deep-fried golden and simply beautiful. My 2 friends, Mild and Spicy, are a couple of salsas that love to hang out all over me. Go ahead, grab me and dip me deep into one of them, slather me in their tomato goodness, I deserve it as much as you do. I have another friend, the cold and refreshing Margarita ($1.75), who simply completes me. Enjoy them slowly while the wandering minstrels play requests from my motherland of Mexico, this would bring a joyful tear to me eye, if I had one.

On the menu you can find many of my brothers, sisters and cousins. My cousin Quesapilla ($6.35) is a real show off though his beginnings are quite humble. Some also call him native fry bread but I just call him a crowd pleasure. Stuffed with gobs of cheese and griddled until melted and bubbly, he tastes just as good as he looks. Spoon on some fresh pico de gallo and you'll see why the ladies swoon and the men groom. My sister from another mother, Quesadilla ($5.95) is a total sweetheart. She's wide, thin and crispy all covered with cheese and I mean that in the nicest possible way. She, Mild and Spicy have a triad relationship, all complementing one another in each melted bite.

Baja Chicken Burro ($8.35) is one of my favorite uncles. He's the uncle who shows up delicious and golden brown, draped in an outrageous creamy coat of sour cream and cilantro, Id have to say he is all about glamour and fashion. Much like season 1 of Project Runway where Jay McCarroll and Wendy Pepper would cat fight every single week, my uncle Baja simply does not get along with auntie Huevos Rancheros ($8.35), a snide but delicious bitch. Her fluffy eggs are perfectly cooked, her delicious Ranchero sauce and her rice and beans make for a satisfying anytime platter.

Not liking to sound like a total me-me, I do have to say that I taste pretty good wrapped around Carne Asada con Pico de Gallo ($11.75). Tender steak grilled to a nice medium and served with pico de gallo, rice and beans. All you have to do is fill me up with some of your juicy meat and it's a win-win scenario. I get to soak up your meat juice and you get to eat all 6"" of my round deliciousness.

Every family has a black sheep and mine is no exception. Coming from a Greek father and a Mexican mother, Gyros Chimi ($8.50), is one of mystery and excitement. Inside she is full of tender slices of roasted gyro meat, gently deep fried then she's covered in the perfect accessory, creamy cucumber sauce. To add to her difference she is served with a hearty baked zucchini complete with sliced onion and a rich tomato sauce. You'll have no idea what you're getting yourself into until you take your first bite, delish.

Unlike auntie Huevos, the Chorizo and Egg Burro ($6.55), is tasty and uncomplicated. Any chance I get to soak in sauce I'm so there! Try the #106 Beef Taco, Cheese Enchilada, Rice & Beans ($8.55) for a celebration of soak. Stuffed with cheese then covered in a slightly sweet and spicy sauce I taste real good if I can say so myself. I also enjoy being bent over, deep-fried then filled with beef and topped with lettuce and tomatoes. One bite into my crunchy exterior exposes my goods for you to enjoy completely.

I'm a firm believer that a meal is never complete without something sugary, it doesn't have to be too big. Fry bread with Cinnamon & Honey ($3.25) is sticky and sweet cousin of mine, who I like to call Fannie. Like my other cousin Quesapilla, she's golden brown, chewy and drizzled with honey and a sprinkle of cinnamon. After tasting Fannie, you might wonder why you've never given her a taste before?

Now that I've been able to share so much of myself with you here today, I feel a great peace and inner joy that can only be brought out by my loyal fans. In whatever form I take from a taco to a warm steamy basket know this, I am here for u., nan",Alexander,676,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Mi Patio,"3347 N 7th Ave

Granted, I am not a fan of Mexican food, but I know good Mexican food when I taste it, and I know bad Mexican food when I taste it.  I will tell you that this place is getting one star solely on the absolutely terrible food I had and the awful service.

First of all, our server was hardly ever present.  I found this strange considering our group of 4 was only 1 of 3 or 4 tables in the whole place.  We ordered an appetizer along with our drinks, specifically requesting for the app to come out before the entrees.  This didn't happen.  In fact, our entrees were served and we never received our app.  After we pointed that out to our waiter who decided to stop by after we were about 3/4 done with our food, the waiter asked if we would like for him to get it now.  Um, no.  We're done now.  Ugh

As for the food, it was far below mediocre.  I got the beef flautas and they were awful.  The meat was as dry as can be and had absolutely no seasoning.  NONE!  The shells were somehow soggy and flavorless.  Boo.  I order one of the easiest things to make on the menu, besides a quesadilla, and I get the worst possible experience.  What a shame.  Everyone else didn't seem too thrilled about their food either.  

I hate this place.  I will never be back.  It's hard to get people to come back when the whole restaurant smells like a port-a-potty.  I can excuse the filth, because honestly, doesn't good Mexican food come from a dirty kitchen?

The owner was kind enough to email me a while back and we discussed what it was I was unhappy with, he gave me some recommendations based on my tastes, and he sent me a gift certificate to try them out again.  This time around, instead of a dismal one star rating, I find myself wavering between 3 and 4.  I will clarify that I would like to give this place 3.5 but I am rounding up because I have never had chicken as juicy as I did the other night in my entire life.

The husband and I stopped by here right after work, at about 4, and there were a handful of tables already full.  As the time progressed, it became much busier.  I would also like to report that the strong artificial cherry port-a-potty smell I picked up on last time is no longer there.  All I smelled was the food.  We seated ourselves, I glanced over the menu, and I knew what I was going to order.  Thanks to reviews from nathan and Amber, I ordered the quesapilla as an app, and for my entree, I went with the Baja Chicken Burro per the owner's suggestion.

The Quesapilla came out quickly and was already oozing cheese.  I cut it open to share and I couldn't help but stare and watch the cheese slowly fall out.  It was like porn to me.  I have an addiction to food porn.  The taste of it was fantastic.  The cheese tasted great and the crispy/soft shell around it was very nice.  The Baja Chicken Burro (a chicken burrito deep fried and then baked, then topped with cheese and cream cheese sauce) was delicious.  The outside was perfectly crisp, there was just enough cheese, and the cream cheese sauce was perfect!  I was nervous about the sauce because I am not the biggest fan of cream cheese, but this was really great.  It was slightly spicy with a really nice cooling effect because of the dairy.  The chicken was incredible.  It was so juicy and so flavorful I thought I might have a foodgasm.  I can't believe I am saying that about Mexican food, but it's true.  They know their chicken.

Overall, the food was fantastic, much better this time, but the service was okay.  It started off really strong with our drinks coming immediately after we ordered them, and subsequently our food, but after we finished we were left waiting about 20 or so minutes just to get our check.  I also couldn't help but notice while we were waiting, that this place seems to be so friendly.  The owner knew so many of the customers by name and was genuinely interested in their lives.  It was refreshing to see that kind of friendliness.  I take back my original review, it was very clearly an off day.  My husband and I very much enjoyed our food this time around.

My dad & I came here for lunch this past Wednesday around noon. The parking lot was packed, that's always a good sign! I have to agree with Rand H, that the restaurant does have an odd shape to it. We were seated at a table that had a chair on one side & a booth on the other, I sat at the booth spot. Our table was kinda wobbly, definitely needed to stick a book or something under the table leg. 

Chips & salsa were immediately brought out & soon after came our drink orders. The chips & salsa were pretty damn good & our server was very on top of refills. For our entrees: my dad ordered a bean & cheese burro & I ordered the baja spinach & feta cheese chimi, both came with a side of rice. Dad enjoyed his burro & ate about 3/4 of it, he didn't eat the rice though because he's more of a beans guys & is watching his carbs. I also enjoyed my chimi, very unique flavors, the rice was yummy & I finished it all. I had about half of my chimi left so I took it home to hubby, along with the rest of my dad's burro & his rice.

Some really great friends of ours got us hooked on Mi Patio quite some time ago.  They are that kind of place that may not get your ""frequent dinning"" card but you'll remember them after a couple of months go by and go back. 

Restaurant ~ it's kind of smallish and cozy looking on the outside but they  really have plenty of room on the inside.  The decor is a fun Spanish style with plenty of vibrant colors and textures.  It's not fancy by any means but very fun!

Service ~ is fantastic! We've been several times and have had different servers and they are all very friendly, helpful and eager to serve to you.

Food ~ chips and salsa are excellente!  We have not had a bad meal here, everything is good!  It probably won't be the best you've ever had but they are very good and extremely consistent.  I prefer their chili relleno or their baja chicken burro or their baja spinach and feta cheese chimi!  On my last visit they combined both baja's into one pollo-spinach-cheesy-delicioso-burro!  Tasty factor times 2!  You can't go wrong with just about anything on their menu.  We try something different on every visit ;-)

Beverages ~ Skip the $2.40 soda... and go for the $1.75 margarita's!!  Yeah!! They may not be the best margaritas but where else can you get a pitcher of this tasty beverage for $9?

I have to say I was almost a little disappointed upon arriving to find that it is a fairly nice restaurant, not the hole-in-wall, don't look under the table, in the window sills, and especially the kitchen, kind of place that we all know have the BEST food.  And with a nicer store front usually comes a higher price tag.  Mi Patio is no different.  Combination plates are in the $10 range.  Kind of expensive for Mexican food in my opinion.  Perhaps I'm still living in 1978.

In spite of that, we were seated and introduced to their chips and salsa.  The chips, unfortunately, were cold.  Had they been hot, they would have been the thin and crispy tortilla chips I love.  But the salsa was really really really good.

Because my husband and I have vowed to eat less in 2010, we shared a meal, an appetizer in fact.  Unfortunately, it was the $17 appetizer supreme that would have fed half of Mexico.  A pizza-sized platter filled with mini chimis, flautas, red chile nachos, and gyro slices (I thought that was odd, but my husband loved them).  We had wonderful service with two people making sure our drinks were kept filled.

I found the restaurant to be much cleaner than on my initial visit, and the service was so attentive and so quick.  We never had our glasses less than half full without getting a refill, and the chips were flowing!  The chips were really good, served warm they were light and crispy!

Our food seriously came out less than 5 minutes after ordering, which is such a bonus when you are on your lunch hour.  My sister had the spinach enchiladas and loved them.  I went with a beef taco and green chile beef burro.  The taco was excellent, the shell was crispy and not greasy and the beef had a ton of flavor.  I usually measure a restaurant based on their green chile and their beans, and these were both excellent.  The green chile had tender beef and the sauce had some nice spicy elements to it.

Actually- you can have it. It's not that great. I was attracted to it because of the $1.75 margaritas. Now I know why they are so cheap... where's the alcohol?!

I would pay more if I could have alcohol in my margarita. They should really change their sign to $1.75 lemonades. 

I do have to say that they have really good chips and salsa. The chips where broken and I had to fish around my bowl to find a full chip but when I did, it was perfect with the fresh, spicy salsa. 

Since I wasn't that hungry, my brother and I decided to just get munchies so we opted for the Supreme Appetizer ($18) which was a giant platter of lettuce, mini chimis, rolled flautas and a machaca salad in the middle. Honestly, I couldn't recognize anything but the flautas. It looked like a salad.

What else is there to say?

 

OK, I have a few more things to say. I started coming here about a year and a half ago because it's a hop, skip and jump from my office and was the go-to Mexi restaurant for special lunches and happy hours.

For its decent food and SUPER-fast and friendly service, you can't beat it. It will satisfy that Mexican food craving but 'tis true it is nothing to write home about. (I imagine if I were from the East Coast or like Idaho or something, I really would write my friends and family regularly to brag about the amazing Mexican food in AZ, just sayin'.)

Cases in point of ""super-fast-and-friendly-service"": 1)Came here for drinks and apps with a friend and were about to settle our tab and head out the door anyway when our server kindly asked if we would mind moving tables to accommodate a large party - and we would be given margaritas on the house for the ""trouble."" 2) Myself and two other friends dropped in for a quick bite and were brought chips and salsa before even ordering - I love that - and our margarita orders were taken immediately and were out within the minute. When our food orders were placed, the plates were out within three minutes - I'm not kidding! And our waters and margaritas were never below the one-third line before being asked if we'd like more. Also, the server gave not one, but TWO freebies: shots of sweet red liquid he simply called ""Mexican Kool-Aid"" (he even smiled when I hissed ""I think we're being roofied, go with it!"") and rice pudding. He apparently thought we might like it, and I sure did.

Anywho, it's consistently fast and friendly and pretty cheap too. Throw in those cheap drinks and what's not to love about that?, nan",Lauren,590,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Mi Patio,"3347 N 7th Ave

It can be loud and the chairs are cheap.  Tables are too close together and sometimes wobble. But I am fond of it. 

Mi Patio doesnt lure hordes of foodie hipsters like El Bravo or Carolinas and the simple Sonoran fare is not remarkably better than Carlos O'Brien's - yet I bristle at Carlos and cop an irrational, almost paternal sentiment towards this place.      

I am fond of Mi Patio because this is the home of nice, hardworking people - and whether they know it or not, their familiar routines and personal instincts comfort me.  The way the old man greets us too loudly before the front door shuts completely behind us.  The way the server seamlessly catches my eye and beckons us to follow him to a back table.   The way you needn't ask the price of recited ""specials"" because Mi Patio is devoid of deception. The way tortillas, wrapped in tin foil, invariably stay hot through your meal.  The way mistakes are courteously corrected without self conscious indignation or crocodile fawning amok in ""better"" restaurants. The way someone, somewhere, is laughing.  The way the old man looks in your eye when he asks how your meal was. The way he notices how tall your kid's grown, even though you only make it in two or three times a year.  The way I have enough cash to cover the bill. The way we take leftovers home and enjoy them that night.   

Growing up in the Camelback corridor, my son has been weaned on corporate and chain restaurants, many of which are quite good. But none of them send him home with cheap bubblegum or a corny riddle, or dare toussle his hair. One day, when my son is my age, this restaurant and the old men - both of us - will be gone.  Perhaps the restaurant name will be lost to memory.

Mi Patio is a mid to low price point Mexican restaurant.  Most things on dinner menu were around $7.00 - $8.00.  The atmosphere is simple and not intended for a ""night out on the town"".  

My ex-husband and I went there tonight.  We had two large entrees, two large size margaritas and the bill was $5.00 after our $20.00 Groupon was applied. The service was top-notch, fast and efficient.  Our waiter explained the specials in a way that enticed me to order one.  The bus-boy refilled our salsa and chips at the perfect moment without being asked.  Our food was served hot and in large portions.  In the middle of the meal, our waiter presented us with two shot glasses full of a ""surprise"" on-the-house-special drink that was very tasty.  When we approached the register to pay after the meal, the gentleman was very friendly about taking our Groupon and he had a genuine spirit of appreciation for us coming into the restaurant, leading me to believe he may have been the owner.

The eggplant enchiladas are pretty good, but they have this light chicken burro plate with cabbage and celery and a really good peppery vinaigrette, that I discovered I preferred without the tortilla, and this is my staple when I visit Mi Patio.
This is a really great place to get tipsy and fed with friends if you happen to live walking distance.... the waiter bought my friend and I a shot after one or two of our meals.... I guess he knew I would tip him for it! :-)

Man the food was great, I had the number 100 which was recommended by the nice waitress.  It was a red beef tamale, beef taco, cheese enchilada, beans & rice.  My 3 year old son was with me so I got him a chicken taco with rice.  I have to say that the taco was the best i have ever had for authentic Mexican.  It was a homemade taco shell (which is really key) and full of meat, cheese, & lettuce.  Not to mention the hot sauce/salsa was spicy and very flavorful and went perfect on this taco.  I loved the tamale too, it wasn't dry and was packed full of meat, the cheese enchilada had a great red sauce and the cheese over everything was not overwhelming.  The beans were great as well which is an important test if you want to know how good a Mexican food place is...well that and the chips and salsa which were addictive too.  The atmosphere is casual with lots of decorations and pictures, you can tell it has been here a long time but it does not look old and run down.

I guess I could head deeper into the aves but, as a rule of thumb, I don't associate the Avenues with solutions. 

From the outside, I was concerned that we were walking into a canned beans, store-bought hard taco shells, overpriced experience. In retrospect, this is probably due to the Corona theme on the outside of the building that made me think of all the substandard Mexican joints in Tempe that survive off the binge drinking college crowd. So, shame on me for such judgement - authentic Mexican doesn't have to come from a rundown brink building in a south Phoenix barrio.

Promptly seated, the service was attentive and the food was good. I got my panfried taco shell (complete with bubbled sides - muy authentico!) and left fat and happy.

We were greeted as soon as we walked through the door, placed at a table where we decided we'd take the bar seats that were open. They had no problems with this, not even a dirty look, that sometimes comes with it. You can definitely tell the staff has some bonds, not sure if it's family or just real good employer employee relationships. Needless to say, I love being lead to believe the workers actually like what their doing. The guy sitting at the bar next to me was obviously a regular, and while we didn't talk much, he was very friendly, and stated that everything was good. 

The salsa was fresh, mild, but Can we say salt? Still had a good hint of lime that I enjoyed. The bright side of this was the chips needed no extra salt, it came in the salsa. The chips were deelish! Freshly made and perfect. For my meal, which came out so fast,  I chose the Carne Asada.  It was a plate of Carne Asada steaks, rice, beans, lettuce, and some pico.  Everything was real good, but the meat was too salty.  On that note, let me just tell you that I LOVE SALT, like I'm guilty of sprinkling it on my pizza (i know thats so bad), so maybe it was just my taste buds that day!  I washed this all down with an ice cold Tecate Light in a can, yup that's right!  I like cans, I'm just weird like that.  The bartender asked if I wanted a mug, so if you don't like cans, don't worry!

I tasted it and was very happy with it, it was like striped cubed beef, not shreeded.  It was good, we probably should have split it, it was huge.

OK- the salsa was good, but it must have been pretty mild because I could eat it. But unfortunately the chips tasted stale and even like the oil needed changing.

We were intrigued by some of the unusual combinations, so we went for the quesapilla. It was good, but in a greasy, boy, am I gonna pay for this later kind of way. It was described as sopapillas with Monterrey jack cheese inside. However, it was served as one large fried gordita-esque thing with cheese pouring out of it. 

I also decided to try the Mexi-Greek thing they have going here, and ordered the Gyros Chimi. The menu claimed that it was served with a side of rice and baked zucchini. The zucchini turned out to be a veggie combo that included eggplant. Good thing I spotted those dirty nightshades before I plunged into my ""zucchini"" or else Hubby would have had to stay home tomorrow to make sure I didn't die. Alright, maybe I wouldn't die, but the last time I ate a mystery veggie mix in a D.C. Moroccan restaurant, it turned out to be eggplant cooked in tomatoes- a double whammy for me- and I was so sick I couldn't leave my hotel room. Anyway, dangerous false advertising. The waiter asked the cook to be sure, and then very pleasantly offered to sub it out. The Chimi was interesting- tasty, but so huge I could only eat a third of it. Hubby did better with his superior Baja Chicken Chimi (thanks for the tip- AGAIN- Julie!). The sauce is outstanding.

We shared a flan for dessert that was pretty tasteless- maybe calling it ""one note"" is kinder. Comedor Guadalajara has no competition here.

The chicken in the chimichanga burrito consisted of all white meat - moist and flavorful. 

My husband had a combo plate - an enchilada, relleno, rice, beans and beef taco. I think the relleno was wrapped in a corn tortilla, not the traditional egg batter. It was a bit strange.  The green chili itself was flavorful. Being from NM, I am used to a red sauce being made from red chili powder. I could not quite distinguish what the sauce was made from that covered the enchilada.

As I said before the food is good, but it isn't the main reason I go there.  I have had several dishes and they have been tastey.  The only thing I would avoid is anything with their red enchilada sauce because it taste like it is from a can.  Just watch out their dishes come out really hot!  They always put out chips and change them when you are getting low, as well they have someone walking around with a jug of salsa to keep you swimming in salsa.

I first noticed that it wasn't too busy which to me was great but for a Friday night, kind of weird, especially with $1.75 margaritas. Awesome, right? Or so I thought. 

I started off with the XL because I save 0.25 that way, me figuring I was going to be getting at least two. They were horrible!!!! They actually caused me physical pain, every sip I took it would cause my stomach to wrench up, I tried chasing every sip with water with no avail. There was no tequila in it at all, it tasted like straight up sweet and sour mix, well maybe expired sweet and sour mix that was left out in the sun for 2 or 3 days. When we asked our waiter about it he just said he didn't understand what we were saying, repeated the price and walked away. I'm a very passive person so no big deal to me.

The food was pretty good, that's what the one star is for. We shared the Baja Chicken Burro. I mean it wasn't anything spectacular but it had a good taste. Nothing that would make me come back though.

The food was good, but it wasn't great. i've definitely had better Mexican food. None of their combo plates had a chimichanga, which was a disappointment for my partner. My combo plate was smothered in sauce and cheese so everything pretty much tasted the same. The enchilada was ok, but nothing spectacular. The shredded beef taco was pretty good. The chile relleno... not so much. The batter was so eggy it was like they made an omelette and wrapped it around the chile. There was more egg/batter than chile, which is unfortunate. The homemade horchata was the best part of the meal. It was almost like a horchata slushie. 

We went for a date night in the middle of the week, and the one comment my partner made as we were getting ready to leave was ""Next time, we go somewhere quiet for date night."" Blah.

Okay okay, I came for the margaritas and dragged my husband and kiddo along with me. 
We decided to just split the gigantor appetizer platter. A guy came out and made my kid a balloon puppy, which he was terrified of, but it was a really neat gesture. Everyone was so friendly. I practically had to beat the waitress off with a stick to get her to stop refilling my water and salsa after each bite/sip.
The platter came out on an XL pizza dish and smelled to die for. I had no idea what I was eating as it all kind of looked the same (good mexican should look the same going in as it does going out though, you know its true) but it was fabulous. Im not sure if the cheese was real, but I don't think I care. There was a ton left over to take home and attempt to reheat later, too, and they had to roll us out to the car.
But the margaritas? Nothing special. I didn't even get a refill, and thats rare for me when around cheap booze. The bathrooms were pretty gross. Hence the star deduction.

The margarita came quickly and it did not lack booze.

I ordered off their ""Specials"" menu and got the Baja Chicken Burro, and asked for beans instead of rice (no problem with the request).

While waiting for the food, I couldn't help eating a bowl and a half of their salsa.  Mmmmmm, mmmmm, good.  I told myself 2 or 3 times that it would be my last chip, but I kept going each time because the salsa was just damn good.

The food came out soon after - big portion, and all very tasty (although I have to admit, the chicken itself was a little bland, but the cream cheese sauce and loads of salsa was a saving grace).

I'm pretty sure I licked the beans off the plate... don't judge.  Did I mention I had had a rough day??

IMHO the Baja Chicken Burro is the best thing on the menu and it's huge - I easily get two meals out of it. The chicken is nicely seasoned and moist, but the best part is the baja sauce that can only be described as bubbly goodness (or as mom would say - lick it off your body good).

This is my go to local restaurant - they serve consistently good food, it's pretty inexpensive, and it's only a few blocks from my house. Now, I'm the first to admit that I'm not much of a food snob, but when I want delicious, no-frills Mexican food and a cheap margarita, this is the place to be.  Don't get me wrong, they do have tons of unique offerings on their menu, but they haven't forgotten about the old classics. Luckily, they provide chips and salsa  to keep you company while you mull over the menu - there are a lot of great things to choose from. Some favorites are the quesapilla (like a sopapilla, but cheesy), the salmon flauta (served with this crazy-tasty pesto sauce), and the Baja Chicken Chimi (cheesy, fried, baja sauce-smothered goodness). Oh, and there was also a time when I was totally addicted to their beef tacos. I mean truly addicted - I craved those things like my sis craved peanut butter and Cheez-its the last time she was pregnant. And it didn't help that their take out taco special is only 6 bucks for two tacos, rice, and beans. Yum.

My boyfriend and I went around 6pm or so. We were seated immediately and brought our drinks. The service was great, we were given our chips and salsa to start munching on while we looked over our menus. One bowl of chips and two servings of salsa were placed on the table and we began chowing down. Chips were fairly warm and salsa was delicious. Just a little bit of spice to give it a kick, but nothing too hot at all so probably great for many palates. :) Our chips and salsa bowls were refilled before they were even half empty and same goes for our drinks. The servers definitely keep up on refills here. We both ended up ordering the same thing: sour cream chicken tacos. We each ordered two. The tacos didn't quite look as appetizing as they actually were so I wasn't expecting it to be nearly as delicious as it was. The shells have quite a crunch to them unless you let it set for awhile to soften up. I personally loved the crunch they had. The serving of sour cream served in a side dish with each plate was HUGE. I definitely didn't expect that big of a serving of sour cream either. Lots of nice surprises. So after throwing a bunch of sour cream on my tacos and adding some salsa to give it a little more moisture and spice, I devoured those tacos like it was my last meal. Our bill ended up being around $17 for our 4 tacos total with only 1 soda (I had water), and we left with full bellies. The tacos didn't look like they'd fill me up as much as they actually did, but once I started eating, they seemed to get bigger. :P I was pretty hungry by the time we arrived, so we went through about 2 bowls of chips and about 5 servings of salsa between the two of us before we actually started on our meals. So, basically we both loved everything about our experience. The chips and salsa, sour cream chicken tacos, and amazing service gets 5 stars from me!

What keeps me coming back though is the food, the price, and the service.  

First of all the food and the price:  Is it going to win any awards for being the top notch mexican place in the Valley?  Probably not, but it's pretty darn good and better than dreadful old Macayo's or any of the other big chains.  And the value is excellent too!  For $22 two people can fill up on endless chips and salsa, enjoy a full plate dinner each, along with 2 drinks and fried ice cream for dessert!  My favorite is the Spinach Enchalada...anything there with the Baja sauce is mucho bueno!!

As for the service, I'm a big fan of small mom and pop type businesses, and I try to support them whenever I can.  I've been going to Mi Patio for about 9 years now and the same people working there today are the same people who were serving me way back when.  The owner is always friendly whenever he is there just hanging out and chatting with you, and its neat to see the same young men grow from bus boys to servers.  To me this says the employees are happy and treated well, and thats the kind of business I like to support!

The ambiance of Mi Patio is very colorful, and family friendly.  There is a bar, along with a smoking and non-smoking section.  It is usually pretty busy around the dinner hour no matter what day of the week, but I have never gone there and had to wait long for a table, if at all.

If you scroll down through most of the reviews you'll see a pattern.  The people who rate it high usually comment, ""You can't beat $2 margaritas!"" or you have a handful of comments from vegans who are happy to have found a Mexican option.  Reviewers who stuck to talking about the food generally had lower ratings, so I had my reservations.  But in the end I was just down the street so I decided to give it a try.

I got the gyro chimi and it just worked.  The flavor of the Greek classic came through perfectly inside of the Mexican wrapping.  The cucumber sauce, lamb, and fried shell matched up perfectly.  The zucchini side was an interesting change of pace and the rice was excellent.  I enjoyed everything on the plate.

One knock against it:  It's oily.  The contents of the chimi (lamb, peppers, onions) can't be as densely packed as a regular chimi so you start to notice some pockets of oil that form on the plate.  Yes, I know a chimi is oily, but you usually it's absorbed by the food inside of it so you don't see it to the same extent.

Give the chimi a shot and you won't regret it.  I was there on a Saturday afternoon and the place has a nice mix of people enjoying some Mexican with others socializing at the bar.  Good options for a wide range of people., nan",Eric,56,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Mi Patio,"3347 N 7th Ave

My old stand-by phrase is, ""A lot of places serve good Mexican food.""  It's true--there are tons of places that will serve up a burrito or rellenos nice and neat, no problem.

And then, there's Mi Patio.  Do you ever get that feeling at the end of a meal where you are completely full but the food tasted so good that you want to continue eating?  That's how I felt here.  These were some of the best enchiladas I have ever tasted.  The rice was authentic, and I ate every speck of the beans.  I often don't finish the beans when I eat at a Mexican joint because they usually taste. . .blah.  No blah here--just REALLY good.  Distinct salsa flavor--more chips please!

My new favorite for Mexifood in the Valley.  There's good places closer to me, but for great, I'll travel a few extra miles to come here., nan",Matthew,618,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Mi Patio,"3347 N 7th Ave

The horchata we got was made in a blender and fresh, not that bullshit you get behind the counter from a soft drink fountain and all watery.  This was the real fuckin' deal and it was delicious.  The cinnamon tasted like genuine cinnamon and it was cold and hit your brain where it mattered.

My machaca burrito was delicious, as always.  Machaca's never let me down, but almost everything else has been better or worse at most places, for a breakfast meat, it's the best around and will never disappoint you.

The chips and salsa they brought it out is always a treat that I enjoy.  The chips?  Eh, whatever, the salsa was the real star of the show and I thought it was tasty; not too spicy, pretty all around solid and I enjoyed the hell out of it before my food arrived.

I have to say though, my beans were, if not from a can, pretty damn close to it in taste.  My side of beans just wasn't very good.  Likewise, I tried some of my girlfriend's rice and was similarly ""meh"" about it.  It wasn't disgusting but if I had the option to not have rice or beans and just have my burrito by itself for a lesser price, I'd do that in a heart beat because the beans and/or rice isn't very good.

While my machaca burrito was intensely good, I had a bite of my girlfriend's tacos and they were not rad.  They were rather un-good.  The meat was dry, they were loaded with mounds of cheese and iceberg lettuce which was kind of weird considering the high rating this place gets.  For a place that gets a consistent 4 out of 5 stars, I was expecting a place that didn't have to rely on mounds of shredded cheese to make up for super dry beef.  

All in all, the place isn't bad.  It clearly depends on what you order.  The service was absolutely as good as could have been expected.  Like Robert O. said in his review, the dude makes his first couple stops without saying a single word.

i get home and its 930pm already.... we don't go out much... so we kinda drove around until we found a Mexican food restaurant that was open and pulled in... there were still a few people inside so were thought SCORE!!!! we walk in and the guy at the cashier was super nice... he seated us... 

i of course ran to the ladies room... mmmm i give it a 3..... its didn't smell to pleasant.... and yes i do expect a bathroom to smell good... you don't wanna your customers to loose their appetites right?? 

by the time i got back we already had our drinks and some chips and salsa i love so much! right away i order some horchata!!! but they freeze theirs.... i never had it like that before... but it was good : ) 

I Got a beef Tostada... oh it was shredded beef.. and they were very generous : ) and my roommate got a Quesadilla it was the size of a med pizza!! it looked sooo yummy!!.... 

the service was supper speedy but our waiter seemed a little irritated... and then the bar turned off its lights... lol we were those annoying people that come in 5 minutes before closing!!!! i felt soooo bad!!! especially after hearing tid bits of what the other employees were saying to our waiter before they left.... (they were speaking Spanish... i know very little) 

we tried to eat as quick as possible... the cashier guy came over and finished being our Waiter... he was so nice... they closed at 10pm we were done and out by 10:08..... i don't think I've ever only spent 18 minutes in a sit down Restaurant before! lol

You can eat as little as you want or as much as you want and still not break the bank. If you're not really hungry you can get something simple like soup or plain tortillas wth beans. If you're starving order a Mexi-pizza.

Each stereotypical mexican entree comes heaping with beans, rice and lettuce- so you will have a plateful of food.

I've been here twice. Both times, the food was solid, but nothing special. I tried the flautas the first time, and a combo plate with chile relleno, cheese enchilada, and beef taco on the second visit. They do give you a lot of food absolutely smothered in cheese, and the prices are moderate. (Doubtful you're getting out of here for under $10/person after tax and tip.) The margaritas are $1.75, but of course very small and full of ice...I wouldn't expect anything different at that price. The horchata is delicious and made with real milk.

So the food is okay, maybe slightly above average. The service seems to be hit-or-miss. The first time I went, I sat at the bar and the service was great and friendly. The second time, however, I brought my girlfriend and we sat at a table. The server couldn't have been much more rude - he was extremely short with us. He basically acted like we were wasting his time and was not friendly at all. The younger guys did come around and keep our chips and salsa well-stocked, but it couldn't make up for the attitude we got from the server in my mind.

I've had their vegetarian burrito, and it was good.  Not great, but good.  I guess I expect a restaurant to be great when the reviews overall are above a 4.  It makes me wonder what I'm missing.

My husband had their chicken taco and didn't like it because the chicken was in breaded nuggets/strips.  I doubt anyone expects a chicken taco to have breaded chicken it.  He sure didn't, and he really didn't like it.  His tastebuds are pretty easy to please when it comes to basic stuff like this, and he didn't even like it.

I also had the Caribbean Martini and it was great.  The ONLY downside to it was that it wasn't filled to the top.  It literally was filled a full inch from the top. No exaggeration.  Since it was happy hour and cheap (I think it cost around $2), I didn't complain.  It tasted great, though!

I think the key thing this place has going for it is its central location.  It's easy to get to, and has a big parking lot.  If you want really good Mexican go to Los Dos Molinos (not super vegetarian friendly, but a few options -- meat eaters and lovers of spice will especially like it here).

The service was slow but very friendly. So +1 star for that. But that's about it. The food, although a nice large portion, seemed like it came out of a microwave. And there was so much yellow (only partially melted) shredded cheese on top, it was way too much. The horchata was grainy and...foamy? The chips seemed stale and the salsa was mediocre at best.

Setting up a wedding at The Fetch House in the historic district, everyone was getting hungry, where to go for good food and not drive across town.
Take out tacos from Mi Patio. I  arrived at the restaurant Sat 12:30, ordered 20 beef tacos and 1 veggie taco to go. 
The tacos come with homemade crispy chips and tasty salsa. Each taco was filled with lots of beef, no skimping on the cheese either. The veggie taco had pinto beans, slices of avocado, lettuce topped with plenty of freshly grated cheese. They did not skimp on the avocado. Delicious! I was feeding 6 very hungry staff members and myself, they would not be disappointed.
My order was completed within 12 minutes! The tacos were packaged in a large aluminum container to keep them upright, hot and easy to transport. The veggie taco was in a separate container. Thank you!
The huge bag of fresh, hot and crisp chips was included, I could not stop eating them on the drive back to the event. The salsa was mild, perfect when serving to a variety of people.

The interior is modest and Patio""est"".  Patio type tables and chairs with Terra Cotta tiled floors and Mexican influenced tchotchke decorations.  Promptly upon seating, a silver bowl full of chips and a side of salsa arrives.  Things are looking up.

Next, time to order a drink or 10.  My first thought is how many places serve a small Margarita for $1.75 and  a large for $3.25?  I am not sure who did the business plan for this place, but generally bars do not use drinks as the loss leader. Shh, don't tell anyone OK?  The large was a healthy size and I am surprised it did not come with a beta fish, so I had two !

Sipping on cheap margaritas helped wash down the somewhat stale tasting chips.  Maybe I am just use to super crisp chips, but the salsa did help with the overall experience.

I ordered the two chicken taco combo with rice and beans ( I always order with double rice and no beans and they accommodated that).  I have to admit, the chicken tacos were stuffed like a Thanksgiving turkey with plenty of chicken, cheese and lettuce.  I was happy with this result and could barely finish.

i never realized how much i hated being in cars until i took a road trip with my mom and dad a month ago. it's not my parents fault, i love hanging out with them. they're hilarious. only my dad can take a boring 15 minute story and turn it into an exciting 3 hour one, and only my mom can debate about something so ridiculous everyone ends up in a fit of laughter. i just don't like being held hostage for hours, trapped in a suffocating seatbelt...... we headed further away from san francisco and closer to LA, and then it hit me all of a sudden. all i could think about was how much i was craving an enormous margarita with some great mexican food. 

i endured more hell when we were forced to turn off the A/C driving through the damn grapevine as my dad yapped on and on about the time my uncle jerry went on a 4 day casino binge with my auntie jeannie and an oxygen tank (don't ask).

we finally hit LA and proceeded east on Hwy 10 towards the arizona border while the thermometer crept towards triple digits.... i couldn't stop thinking that my enormous margarita and mexican food was getting closer by the minute. time dragged by as we passed a random cactus or five through indio, coachella and finally blythe, until the border finally came into sight. i was giddy. 

the last stretch! through the 112 degree arizona desert to, downtown central phoenix... my mouth could already taste the margarita. it would be potent, it would be served in a large glass. on the rocks, no salt. i call my brother, hands shaking.... ""JOEY dammit, i need good mexican. big margaritas. cheap. NOW!""

our little slice of heaven just happened to be about a block or so from my brothers place, so we picked him up along the way. i could hardly contain myself as we soared into Mi Patio's parking lot, my door already open before the engine was off.

i noted as we walked in it's not big or fancy, but it's cheerful, festive and warm. mom and pop type joint. you can tell by the smell, the food is going to be good.  

yes, they serve $1.75 margaritas. you read that right, $1.75... my mom looked worried when she saw the gleam on my face. as you can probably guess, these cheap wonders aren't all that potent, or all that big. so i just ordered an extra shot with mine and the price was still only a few bucks more. the $2 beer specials made my dad pretty happy. the bar, already packed, seemed to be an obvious happy hour spot.

next the food. no salsa is ever hot enough for my dad. it burned my mouth pretty good, but i'm not exactly a manly man so i stuck to the milder one... my brother, dad and i all ordered the carne asada picado burro while my mom had the chicken burro. now my mom is a mere 97 lbs and rarely finishes her whole plate, so it's really a testament to this place that she almost did, or even tried. (especially since they really heap the food on) the collective response from around our table was... yummm. for the price, you're coming out way ahead. trust me.

halfway through dinner, as they seated 3 strapping phoenix police officers next to our table, i realized the quality of the food here wasn't just my imagination (or the effects of heavy tequila consumption). in my experience, anywhere you see a gaggle of local cops eating, is a sign of decent food. right?

i left there thinking, what sweltering desert? do your worst arizona! if you keep feeding me like this, i'll take on your heat any day of the week., nan",Michelle,620,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Mi Patio,"3347 N 7th Ave

We got free shots, delicious salsa, warm chips and the entree was decent. However, as I continued to go there the service seemed to get worse. The last time was most upsetting and made me decide to never return.  We actually had to hunt down our waiter to take our order because he was taking so long to come back. He was busy watching the ball game and socializing with 2 other people up at the bar. We were pretty convinced that our waiter was high. He had absolutely no perception of time, he was sweating, loud and his pupils were ginormous. The chips seemed to be burned from the heat lamps and the chips that were not burned tasted a bit stale.  When we got our entree the ends of my enchilada were hot but the middle was cold. That leads me to believe that it was previously frozen and it actually tasted like frozen food. My boyfriend's food tasted like Franks Red Hot. Don't get me wrong, we love franks but I don't expect it to be the sauce they use to flavor their food.

My awesome girlfriend worked overnight so she was not able to appease my insatiable appetite for some authentic Mexican food on this gorgeous Saturday morning. So I did what any guy would do in my situation.. Yelp ""best Mexican breakfast"".  After sorting through some establishments with mediocre ratings I came across Mi Patio. Hmm a four star..of course I was instantly suspicious as Phoenix has not delivered on quality Mexican food since my transplantation from San Diego ten years ago. I was, nevertheless excited, as I made my way to this centrally located cocina. 
As I entered I was greeted and seated promptly. I was the first customer aside from 2 at the bar having a Bloody Mary. The hostess was quick to bring coffee, water, chips, and salsa to my table which I immediately partook of. 
The coffee was hot but possibly reheated. Needless to say I had 3 cups of the cafesito. The chips were very good.. Hot and fresh. The accompanying salsa(which definitely spent the night in the fridge)was ok a bit on the salty side.  I have had worse but also much better. 
For my platillo I ordered the carne asada, enchilada combo with rice and beans. The presentation was ok as I immediately noticed the cheese overkill. The plate was drowned in the yellow stuff. The server warned me as she brought out the supposedly hot plate towel in hand. My first bite of the arrozito debunked this myth of hot food out the kitchen. 
Having had my first bite of the rice  I hesitantly tried a mordida of the cheesy beans and bistek. As previously mentioned the beans were not distinguishable amongst the sea of yellowness. The carne was ok nothing to write home or yelp about. The final disappointment to this dish was the flour tortilla that came on the side wrapped in a steaming foil. As I unwrapped its silver lining and handled it I could see and feel this was a sorry store bought excuse of a tortilla    Taking a forced bite confirmed my suspicions.

 Best parts about Mi Patio:
-service. You can be seated, ordered, eat ad leave within 45 minutes, and that is with the free shot they sometimes give you!
-price. You can go to plenty of other highly rated places and pay double the price....and this is better food.
-fam owned-most of the people have worked there forever. They remember the regulars orders (and this place is so good there are a lot of regulars)

Favorite Food:
-beef tacos-delicious. You can request with onions and tomatoes otherwise it comes with lettuce and cheese. I recommend #96-two tacos, beans and cheese. Mixing the beans together and adding a little hot sauce on top is delicious. **if you order this for pickup or to go it is a $1 cheaper by the way!** #106 Is another good combo.
-Baja chicken burro. Oh my god delicious. This dish is all about the sauce. It goes so well together. **you can ask for the sauce on anything I learned by the way
-chips and salsa are constantly being replenished and are so yummy and homemade 

If I had to find negatives/to be straight up:
-not my favorite guacamole. Not a lot of flavor.
-quesadillas aren't always that crispy
-margs aren't the strongest or made with the too ingredients but they are cheap and still yummy. Ask for a double with not too much ice!

I was slightly wary, as my fiance and I have had plenty of Mexican food all around Phoenix (and, since I'm from Tucson, right along the Mexican border), and are pretty versed in it. It's always difficult trying new Mexican places, because once you know what's good, you keep coming back. Let me say I'm extremely happy we gave this place a shot. 

First of all, the service is absolutely incredible. I work as a hostess in a 5-star restaurant in Paradise Valley, and I swear the servers there pale in comparison to the people working at Mi Patio. Our server was super-attentive, gave us the time we needed to look over everything, and made sure we knew all the deals before ordering (for example, if you do go, get the $3.50 large margarita instead of the $1.99 regular-size. It's more than double the drink for not even twice the price). He checked up on us as soon as we'd taken two bites of our food, and always made sure our drinks were full. The girl bussing was also incredible; she always made sure we had plenty of chips and salsa, as well as full water glasses, and cleared everything the moment we were through. Keep in mind, all of this was during the dinner rush, so it wasn't as though they were attentive because the restaurant was empty; this little place stays consistently crowded. 

The food was pretty good, too; I loved the salsa, and my tacos were delicious. My fiance had chili relleno, which wasn't quite as good, but still pretty tasty. Not to mention the fact that everything is super-cheap (as Mexican food often is).

The servers are always fast and friendly.  the owner and managers talk with us like we've been friends our entire lives even though they may not even recognize that we are regulars.  we eat at mi patio for dinner, lunch and get lunch takeout.  it is always exactly what we were hoping for.  

if you enjoy hot sauce we've discovered that they make a spicy sauce using Frank's red hot but you have to ask for it.  we ask for the diablo sauce since that is what they use for the diablo shrimp dish.

mi patio is great for vegans too.  they don't cook anything with lard and give you the opportunity to order anything without the cheese, without looking at you like your crazy.  Ive enjoyed the vegetable enchiladas (Mushroom, Zucchini, Egg Plant) without cheese and didn't feel like i was missing out on flavor.

their chips and salsa are my favorite in all of phoenix and they give you plenty with your food whether its to stay or to go.  

kids are always treated with respect and they have tons of tolerance for our occasionally screaming 1 year old.  the kids meals have huge portions that make for great left overs and ice cream when theyre done!  our 5 year old asks to eat at mi patio at least twice a week.

we LOVE the margaritas!  there's nothing fancy about them but who needs fancy when you get to pay 2 or 3 bucks for a big ass margarita!? 

don't let the outside of the building trick you into thinking its just a sleazy Mexican bar.  the beer banners totally turned me off before my husband made me try it for the first time.  just walk inside and enjoy the best of Phoenician Mexican food!, nan",Sarah,12,"['Mexican', 'Restaurants']",Mi Patio,"3347 N 7th Ave

Mi Patio is unique to any other Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix metropolitan area as the cuisine is Mexican with a Greek influence to some of their dishes. 

Mi Patio is also distinguished from other Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area because it FEELS like it's family owned. More often than not one of either of owners will personally inquire about your dining experience.

I've never had anything but great food at Mi Patio and although most Mexican restaurants are generous with their portions Mi Patio is extremely generous. You won't leave Mi Patio hungry.

It's hard for me to pick the best item on the menu but I'm fond of the Mexican pizza and the Greek-Mex salads.

And although this is a very clean family atmosphere it also has a great bar. The bar is short and in the front of the restaurant but it feels like the neighborhood bar where you know the names of everyone sitting there before you finish your first drink. Like many of their customers you may have first heard about the business from word-of-mouth. They serve great margaritas for $2.00. :-)

Mi Patio is one of my favorite restaurants in Phoenix and I stop in whenever I can. And a lot of times when I don't have the time to eat there I get food to go (their to-go menu is really inexpensive - something like $4.95 for a two taco plate with rice and beans.)

I walked into mi patio and although the ambience had me worried as it seemed like a cheesy american mexican place.

They quickly brought me fresh chips and a nice spicy salsa--definitely a good start.  I had trouble deciding on what to order, so I ordered the veggie combo which combined a # of things off the menu.  Although it was on the greasy side, the food was fresh and all very tasty.  I added some hot sauce to some of the dishes as they were a bit on the mild side.

We used to live not far and remembered it fondly, but returned w our family recently (daughter and two well-behaved teens) and could hardly get out quick enough. In a town with plenty of quality Mexican restaurants, this was our sad experience: stale chips, sooo sweet margaritas from a commercial mix, ""char-broiled taquito"" consisted of soggy tortilla and steamy meat that had not recently experienced any charbroiling, shared fajitas churned out with no caramelizing or evidence of time on a plancha, essentially hot meat and vegetables w two tiny tortillas.  What happened to the old Mi Patio? Maybe it doesn't exist at 6 on Friday nights.

While I can't exactly fault the restaurant for our being trapped next to a raucous group of nine people at a table sized for six (they kept pulling up another chair ""Sure, we can make room""), I do think well-run restaurants are attentive to the realities of maneuvering around with hot plates when tables are overfilled. That's on the end of server experience; as for diner experience, at one point, two of us had hand over an ear to soften the donkey-loud laugh of the woman next to us. Maybe it was amplified by the tunnel-like area near the back door, which we used to escape as soon as we popped cash (and a tip-it's hardly fair to punish the server) in the folder.

I'm glad I did.

It's a structure that looks small on the outside but is fairly large on the inside, at least to my eye. Yet it still gives off a very friendly, cozy vibe, if not an oppressive one. 

Plastic parrot ornaments, most decorated in colors not seen in real parrots (says this person who is owned by two birds) and parrot paintings serve as the primary decorations. What's not to like?

I was worried that the place would be freezing, given the 85-degree heat of the daytime (it had since cooled to about the low 60s), but I needn't have been. It wasn't chilly at all, much to my delight.

I was seated promptly in the busy dining room by a man who was busily bopping to and fro. As such, he didn't say much to me and kind of threw the menu down on the table and hustled away. 

That's one of only two complaints (the other one in a minute): He seated me in a somewhat darkened area of the floor, perhaps not noticing I had a book with me. (Honestly, there was only one other two-top available, adjacent to mine, in the area where he led me, and the lighting wouldn't have been any better over that table, either. It looked as if there were better-lighted tables he could have put me at in the room in the back and to the right, but I wasn't that upset about it, so I let it go.)

Other reviewers have mentioned how prompt the busboys are with the refills of chips and salsa and water and soda, and I read them and kind of took them with a large grain of salt. But I was amazed to see it in action; I had barely gotten down to the crumbs in one bowl of chips before the busboy was coming over with a fresh bowl; he plopped that down on the old bowl. The chips were warm and held salt very well. So addictive. 

A few seconds later, he came by with a plastic Thermos full of salsa and unloaded into my salsa dish, thus topping it off. Sodas and waters were refilled before I even knew they were depleted. On the whole, it's got to be some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.

My other complaint: My request to build a custom vegetarian quesadilla--or to remove the mushrooms from the mushroom-zucchini-eggplant enchilada--was denied. It's an odd discordant note on a restaurant that clearly seems to pride itself on doing what the customer wants. (I didn't ask for anything exotic in the custom veggie quesadilla, just broccoli, zucchini, and carrots. The waiter, whom I still tipped 20 percent, said the kitchen didn't have broccoli or carrots. Say what? Whatever. I ordered the mushroom-zucchini-eggplant enchilada, single version as opposed to double version.)

The food (there was plenty of it) came out fairly quickly and was hot. Honestly, I couldn't distinguish the mushrooms, so I just ate everything. I was glad I didn't order the double enchilada; I wouldn't have been able to finish the second one.

All this for an eye-poppingly low price of $10.88? With free refills on the soft drinks? Are you kidding me?

Came here before heading out to the airport since it was right in the hotel we were at (Harrah's). It's located right near the exit of where the Mickey Ds/Panda Express/Chipotle is. It was breakfast time on the border of lunch when we arrived and it was about $19. I think they have a deal where you can get unlimited alcoholic drinks? The customer service from the cashier and our waitress was excellent. 

On to the food, it was pretty decent. From the looks of it, I thought it was going to be bad but I enjoyed most of the food I ate.  The hash browns were nice and buttery, which I got thirds of. The other selections were small but I liked it better than Cravings at Mirage...I think anywhere is better than there. For $19, not worth it. Maybe $10??

With that as a starter, went the BBQ route by adding BBQ baked beans, mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese and some smoked kielbasa sausage. Overall it was ok. Good but not mmmmmm!  Next, I had a few bites of my wife's clam chowder. I was surprised at the chunks and tenderness if the clams! Very pleased with this particular flavor of New England clam chowder which enticed me to try a seafood plate. As I approach the seafood area I changed my mind. Cocktail shrimp I have to peel?!? C'mon man! No thanks. The fried cod wasn't looking to appetizing either, so I moved on to another ""flavors"" section. Tried a variety plate including fried chicken, cause you can't mess up fried chicken. Tasted like KFC. Added some orange chicken wings and some ""crab"" rangoon. Well the ""crab"" rangoons were veggie. They tasted like egg rolls except they were shaped like rangoons. Not very tasty and misleading? C'mon man! The chicken wings were to crispy to eat. I managed to tear off a piece and chew it for 5 minutes until deciding it wasn't worth it. Ok so no more ""food"", onto desserts. My choices were: mini strawberry cheese cake which was VERY rich! I ate half of it. Boston Cream Pie cupcake, gone in one bite. Coconut Cream Pie cupcake, gone in one bite. Chocolate crunch bar, gone in two bites. Bread pudding was pretty good with vanilla sauce drizzled in top. Some type of apple streusel with a sweet sugary sauce also was tasty. The dessert certainly bumped it up a whole star. The service was 4 stars. Our waitress always made sure our drinks were full though. Even tried to get my wife to get another glass of wine! My first two beers were just a little cooler than room temp, they fixed that with the next two icy cold Coors Lights. Overall experience was subpar to average at best.

And ended up eating my body weight in shellfish.  Ain't no shame in it.

Seriously though, my dad and I are big fans of crab and shrimp, so we were in heaven.  The Italian food wasn't bad, and my parents really liked the BBQ dishes.  (The salad was only okay, but who goes to a buffet for salad anyway?)  The desserts were plentiful and they even offered sugar-free versions of cheesecake and mousse (perfect for my mom and dad) as well as gelato and cotton candy.

 I was not really impressed with this buffet.  There seemed to be something seriously wrong with the seafood selections.  The stone crabs and crab legs were really hard to open and retrieve any meat from; so I gave up on them.  From the other reviews I read, it seems like the crab legs were hot.  The ones we tried to eat were on ice.  Also, the prime rib seemed super fatty.  They had a good selection of Southern food and I liked the burrito bar.

So let's talk about the food instead. Mmm Mm! 

Round One: Started with a salad. Just about eveything you could think of wanting on a American-style buffet salad, kinda wished there were kidney beans but the Ranch dressing made up for it. Ranch the way restaurant Ranch is supposed to be. Creamy without being thick, flavorful and heavy on the dairy.

Round Two: Fried Raviolis - Not what I wanted them to be. The fried outside overwhelmed the stuffing and I could only eat two before I was bored. Hush Puppies - tasted like your mama's. Roasted Red Potatoes - crispy but soft to bite into, spiced nicely and not too salty. Steamed Veggies - tasted like the vegetables they are. Stuffed Shell in Seafood Sauce. The Stuffed Shell... OH MY GOD. So delicious! I wished I'd gotten just a solid plate of them!

Round Three: Two more Stuffed Shells. I told you they were good!! Stuffed with Ricotta, Egg and spices, topped with some kind of white sauce with just a hint of seafood, not some overpowering fishy taste, then fresh, chopped tomatoes on top. So yummy but soooo filling. What? No room for desert?

Ok, Round Four: A slightly painful Chocolate Covered Rice Krispie Treat. Only painful because I was so full!! There's a chocolate fountain at the end of the buffet and an assortment of snacks to dip in it. The chocolate is flavorful, not that bland, stale taste that sometimes happens to chocolate fountains.

Ok, the things I personally missed: Crab Legs - Everybody loved these. My girls at the end of the table split three plates worth. Shrimp Cocktails - Two of my party went back for Shrimp Cocktail seconds when I went back for my Stuffed Shells. Gourmet Desserts - There's a whole section of them with Pastry Chefs hanging about to answer questions and take personal orders.

1. It's a buffet.  Everything is cooked institutionally. 
2. You can find better buffets if y you want to spend exorbitant amounts of money.
3. There are just some things that should never be institutionally cooked. .. like eggs benedict.

Other than that, here are a few things that Mabee this buffet great.

1. They had miniature Belgium waffles with a variety of toppings, yum.
2. Egg station where they cook omelets and eggs any style to order.
3. Grits, oatmeal, and cream of wheat.
4. Good chicken fried steak and country gravy.
5. The parfaits, cupcakes,  and desserts were amazing.
6. Roast new york cut beef and kielbasa.
7. The servers were awesome.   They were eager to please and very attentive. 

One of the most important things to do is to get a great deal.   $18.99 per person is a little high for breakfast.  If alone, get a player's club card, play a little and use your comps to offset the cost.  If you don't play, then get a card anyway and get the $1 discount.  If party of 2 then get groupon and $28.99 for 2 includes all you can drink mimosas or bloody marys.  

There is a little confusion about Groupon calling this a half price deal.   The deal is with the alcohol.   It would normally be $18.99 plus $10.00 for the alcohol add-on.

Even if you don't drink,  it's still a good deal.  You save $9.

Overall, for the money, it's a great buffet, and perfect for those morning afters that Las Vegas is so famous for.  YMMV!  ENJOY!!, nan",Doug,14,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

To start off, we literally waited almost 45 minutes in line to even get into the buffet.  And, this was a Monday night and it wasn't all that busy.  One thing that really pissed us off was that we were 3rd or 4th in line, but they have this Express Line.  If you pay an additional $5 per person, you get to go into the Express Line ahead of everyone else.  It was quite infuriating to see people walk in and get seated ahead of you when you've been waiting 45 minutes to be seated.

Crab legs?  Yea, they have them.  In fact, that's why we went.  But, they were either under cooked or way overcooked and you could hardly get any meat out of them.  They were definitely not worth the wait or the price!

The best things were the spaghetti with alfredo sauce and the big selection of desserts.  The carved ham wasn't too bad either.  The prime rib was cold and extremely fatty.

I'm thankful that we had a buy one, get one free coupon because it was worth MAYBE $10 instead of the normal $19.99.

This is probably the first breakfast buffet I've had aside from those that are complimentary at some hotels, and I was very happy with it. It offers plenty of choices - your standard American fare, some Mexican and Chinese stuff (though the latter seemed like left overs from the night before) and plenty of sweets.   That's what I went for, and I was quiet happy.

The mini lemon cheesecakes, raspberry pudding cups, cheese blitz and apple crepes were all excellent  - you'd be happy if you got them at a 5-star restaurant.  Also nice were the bread pudding with vanilla sauce, the cinnamon roll and the brownie.  Less successful was the custard (not sweet enough), the croissants (a bit dry) and the bacon (good flavor but dried out).  The sausages, on the other hand, were great.  Skip the heavy, cakey doughnuts and the chewy bagels, though there is lox if you want them.  The pancakes and French toast could have been better, I wouldn't bother with them.  The biscuits were good, but look for the ones in the warm tray.

Don't skip the fruit, while the strawberries were tasteless, the watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew melon were perfectly ripe and sweet - they were a hit with my husband and kids.  The pineapple was the canned type, but my youngest enjoyed it.

There is also a carving station (ham, I think) and make-to-order omelets, which we didn't try.  You can order ice cream as well - I wasn't too fond of the strawberry one.

As for drinks, the coffee was fine, the hot cocoa standard, I felt the chocolate milk was weak but my daughter liked it.

The minus part of the buffet is that we got it as part of the ""Buffet of buffets"" deal, but we were so full after eating it that we couldn't take advantage of the lunch buffet that was included in the price., nan",Margarita,93,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

Not only do they have ice cream and all the toppings (Including hot toppings!), but they also have a great selection of mini cupcakes (let me recommend the lemon... yum!) AND cotton candy to go!  So, if you just want to get your dessert on, I would check this out.  They have huge slices of pies and cookies and other little bites, but a really nice selection of GOOD stuff.  Although, they have swapped out doing Creme Brulee for a flan style custard.  Dummy heads.

The second reason is while they don't have 500 tastes, the ones they do have are pretty darn good.  The prime Rib was PERFECT.  They have containers for your condiments.  The service is good and it felt like an overall value.

We were doing the Buffet of Buffets so I didn't look at what the price was when we went for lunch, but I'm sure it was over $20.  The only negative was they made you take a picture before you went in and hand you this giant fork and spoon, which kind of grossed me out since I had just washed up in preparation for eating!

Plenty of variety, including all the regular breakfast food staples. Everything tastes fresh and they have an omelet station where you can order your very own special omelet just the way you like 'em. 

I recently came for dinner with my husband for the first time. I didn't think the dinner buffet was at the same level as breakfast. Though the same amount of foods and cuisines were still available, not much appealed to me. Of the things I tried, most were just average. I didn't go back for seconds on anything. That was really okay with me because what they were lacking in regular food, they more than made up for in the dessert section, so I was able to fill up on tons of sweets. Flavors offers more desserts than some of the larger and more high end buffets, and they are still quality sugary goodness. Tons of ice cream and sherbet to choose from, cupcakes, pies, pastries, bread pudding, creme brûlée... you name it, they've got it. They even have a cotton candy machine where you can grab your own little stick of spun sugar!

One thing I noticed when browsing both regular food items and desserts is that the labeling was off. Maybe it was just on this particular evening, because I don't remember this being an issue during breakfast in the past, but many foods were not labeled at all and several were mislabeled as the wrong item. Others must have noticed this as well because I overheard another man tell his wife ""Hey! That's not hot fudge sauce! That's apple pie!"" Ahhh... Smart man right there. Good eye; good eye. 

I would be willing to give Flavors another shot for breakfast, but definitely not for lunch or dinner. As much as I love desserts, I want them to be an ending to my meal, not the majority of my meal., nan",Holly,142,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

The fruit was to die for, just the right amount of ripeness, strawberries were soooo good!  Pancakes, waffles, cereal, tons of different ways potatoes were prepared, good selection of fruit for this time of the year, oatmeal, GRITS (I was sooooo happy about this), tons of pastries, our drinks were always kept full.

Lines weren't too long. Environment was spacious. Staff at the register and seating were friendly and funny. The waiter was helpful and most of the time prompt. I didn't interact too much with the cooks but they seemed to have fun in the kitchen. 

There is a ton if categories to choose from fresh salads and fruits, seafood, American, Italian, Asian, Indian, Mexican and of course dessert! Quality of food was good! Although there were a few items that didn't turn out so great, but I could have just picked it at an off time! I was extremely satisfied and definitely feel I got my money's worth! 

I would recommend doing Flavors buffet, especially in the 24 hour buffet pass! It's a great deal and necessary fuel for all the Vegas festivities.

This buffet has a variety of types of food stations from seafood to pasta to American grill sort of stuff, etc. But seriously, everything was mediocre at best. The ONLY things I actually enjoyed were the crab stuffed tilapia, the quesadilla, and the little cheesecake cup. The rest of the food I picked at, and I tried nearly everything. 

Now I probably would've given them a 3 star rating as befits mediocrity, but added to the lame food was the fact that we waited in line for an hour despite the fact that we could see that an entire side of the restaurant was empty. Perhaps that was a staffing issue, but it still seems like bull.

I'm not a picky eater, just look at my previous reviews lol. I grew up poor so I know the struggle, and I wasn't looking for fine dining at $27. This place still disappointed me, though.

I was excited for the crab legs, but couldn't even eat them. They were too salty. Like a previous reviewer said, it's like they were soaked in salt water. On the other hand, the mussels were ""marinated"" but they were so bland! I'm a seafood lover, so this was upsetting for me that their seafood was not up to par. 

Eating in Thailand, a third world country, was more delicious (not saying that the food in Thailand is supposed to be gross or anything, but cmon). 

The rest of selection was okay, if a bit small. The Mac and cheese was creamy, the spaghetti was very flavorful, probably the most flavorful I've had! The tortillas were a little hard (not the hard shell ones but the ones that were supposed to be soft) so it seemed like they were left there for awhile. They only had chicken fajitas to fill them with also, which disappointed me. I love carne asada tacos haha.

The desserts were average. The ice cream was yummy and they had gelato as well. The chocolate mouse and mint mousse in the cups were plain, even according to my brother. The chocolate ecstasy was very delicious though if you're a chocolate lover. 

Overall, it wasn't anything special really. I would give it 1.5 stars.

The service, like stated by previous reviewers is the reason why I gave the extra star. They were attentive and very friendly, though there was an elderly woman worker complaining about being tired within earshot. I know it was close to closing time, but you shouldn't act like that in front of customers. This is coming from a past manager in retail. Presence and attitude is key to a happy experience on the guest's behalf. That was the only person who wasn't very good with service. Special thank you to the Asian worker who was so funny and nice though!

This buffet is cheaper than a lot of buffets in Vegas. There's a good amount of selection here - someone for everyone almost. 

The cocktail shrimp is peel yourself and the beef ribs are ginourmous! The dessert was watery and lacking taste - it's usually my favorite part of the meal! Ice cream was good though.

Score! (We ate for about $16 a piece)

The good: 
-Prime rib, really not that bad for a 3rd tier buffet. Not overcooked like Rio.
-Nice sized snow crab legs, but ya gotta work to get em open as they aren't halved.
-Shrimp Cocktail, gotta shell em but they were fresh.
-Champagne included
-Hot fudge sundae for dessert...amazing how many buffets in Vegas don't have simple hot fudge to go with their ice cream or ""gelato"". It's usually chocolate syrup...here the fudge is hot!
-Kind and friendly staff
-They have a guy coming around with some hot specialty items...like right to your table...haven't seen that before...had some hot chicken skewers and some coconut tapioca thing...wasn't bad.

The bad:
Where are the correct food cards and how come they aren't placed in the right spot? The whole entire buffet had either no names to their dishes or incorrect names. Pancakes were Spanish rice, this whole other area with a pastry puff with ""something"" inside was a complete unknown and none of their desserts had any titles anywhere...is this the sugar free section? What is this? I hate sugar free, but who knows...and if you have a name card that says pancakes and it's 9pm, it means that no one bothered to make the food card change at all for the entirety of lunch and all the way to the end of dinner. Hash browns all day or is that ravioli?

Overall a 3.5 due to the groupon, but I just can't hand it a 4...however, for $16 I will come back., nan",Aaron,96,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

I saw this buffet on a few top ten lists, all of which praised it for being far more affordable than the other top-notch Vegas buffets.  
My experience was laughably bad.
First, it's only $10 cheaper than some of the best buffets in Vegas (Bellagio may be my fave) at $27, and the experience is night and day.
Much of the food was mislabeled or had no name cards at all, and when I'd mention that fact to the cooks behind the counter, they literally shrugged.  I asked to move to a table near an outlet so I could charge my phone, and the waiter told me ""no one will help you there"", so I sat 15 feet from where they sat me... He walked past me 10 times and never got me a drink or said another word to me.
The food was just OK. Not as big a selection as the Rio or Wynn, and while I'm not big on shellfish and sea food, I'd say that was the strength of this buffet. The dessert selection was huge, but much lower-quality than any of the top-notch buffets.

Food: 
1. Primed ribs: wow super rare... I didn't bother touching it

2. No wine or champaign means no mimosa :( so I just got cranberry juice

3. A lot of Cajun food , which I love. Delicious sausages, chicken, veggies, and mashed potatoes. Corn bread was so bomb! Lots of carbs. Corn was kinda burnt tho.

4.BBQ ribs were mediocre. Someone told me that the meat only falls off the bone if it's over cooked but I guess I like it overcooked. This ribs was yummy and saucey but it didn't come off the bone easily

6.cheesecake was light and creamy. Comes in a really small bowl so you can have self control

7. Free cotton candy that you can take out. Comes in purple, pink, and blue
8. Crab legs were fresh but small. Just grab a bunch so you don't have to keep going back and forth

9.Alfredo and marinara pasta and thai noodles are so good!! The pasta was cheesy and hot. Thai noodles was kinda plain but I'm fine with it

10. Gelatto: mint, chocolate chip, passionfruit, vanilla flavors: yes I have tried them all in one sitting...shhh

The seafood (mussels, prawns and crab legs) doesn't look that fresh but I still did give it a chance and try it. Crab legs is sweet but very salty, taste that it has been soaked in salt water. Cold prawns does not look appetizing too, and worst the mussels...look like it's been taken out from the freezer and they just unfreeze it. I felt so disgusted by the mussels.

Cooked food is average, nothing fantastic. Desserts look cheap...mostly cupcakes. Cupcakes look home-baked and very child-like. Presentation of desserts is horrible. I'm a dessert lover and I didn't even want to try anytime that is how bad it is! Even the ice cream looks cheap!

- flavorless skirt steak at the carving station
- mussels that looked like they were cooked 3 days ago
- sloppy, uninspired, visually nauseating ""Asian"" and ""Mexican"" dishes
- polish sausage looked good, but I was unable to chew more than once before spitting it back on my plate
- oyster shooters (which I typically love) looked terrifying
- I'm almost sure the Bloody Mary's in my ""all you care to drink"" add-on were virgin, and to give them any flavor at all you had to spice them up at the laziest Bloody Mary bar ever put together by human beings

The only bright spots were the salad which was a solid average salad bar (at least the lettuce was fresh) and the very above average dessert station.

I got this from their website but it's spot on, We were in vegas for a bachlor party last weekend and this place brought us back to life after long nights! i had brunch here twice!!! It was delicious maybe just good hangover food, But damn when are you not hung over in vegas?

The weird fake looking pizza that i normally wont even try at a buffet was pretty damn good! i had to check it out after my buddy's were talking about how great it was. The shrimp was pretty decent and the veggies were even kinda fresh.

My favorite plate i had was filled with biscuits and sausage gravy that didn't just fall apart when you stabbed them with your fork, And the gravy actully had peices of sausage in it not just flavored that way, Eggs that were so so i guess can't really mess up scrambled eggs, French toast that was just delicious and crab leggs stacked to the roof... I never thought i'd eat crab legs for breakfast much less occumpanied by french toast. Maybe i was really muffed up but it was deliscious. Throw in a bunch of free beer and champagne to wake you up, with a few crazy stories from the couple next to you and now thats how to start a day in vegas! 

I would recommend it to anyone. Im sure there are better buffets in lv but i doubt theres anything near as good for the price, save your money for alcohal and clubs, nan",kyle,36,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

So to start the reason for the two stars and not one was simply they have grab legs and prime rib at a half decent price.  Now to start the details of this horrible experience.

The service:
Ok to start 4 of us went to dinner this evening, my wife and my friends wife are full Mexican however they look white and are fluent in both English and Spanish. We ordered a round of Coors light's and bloody marry's. The drinks came and the beers were seriously room temperature and the bloody marry's were so spicy they were undrinkable. The waiter overheard my wife and my friends wife speaking Spanish, and started conversating, we later found out through conversation in Spanish only now that the waiter saw ""us white people"" and kept poring in Tabasco and grabbed the warmest beers he could find. This was just so him and his fellow staff could have a laugh. As soon as he found out we were Mexican and spoke Spanish the quality of service took a 180. Without asking the waiter brought us 4 ice cold beers, new bloody marry's and wine for our wives. Our drinks always got filled and he even brought all of us beers and drinks to go plus two decks of playing cards. I found this to be a complete joke and no wonder why tourism is down.

The food:
The food was of a typical buffet, the crab legs were ok, the prime rib was ok as well, although in my opinion it was over cooked. I did feel the buffet was a bit smaller then the ones I had been to at the other casinos. The deserts were horrible, and some of the worst I had ever seen at a buffet. I tried every single one and not one was I able to muster a 2nd bight and this wasn't just me all four of us at the table felt the same way. The ice cream was the only desert I was able to eat and it wasn't to bad either I think it may have been made in house. 

In summary I will never go back to this buffet unless I hear that it gets revamped, nore do I recommend this buffet to anyone.

Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.

Came here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.

I can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces. 

Couple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon ""sushi"". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll. 

For about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of ""ehh"" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food. 

P.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor.

The hot crab legs were a tasty treat and once I got the hang of cracking I was on my way to butter crab soup heaven!

The downside of this buffet is the selection really, they have a star like crab legs and the rest of the food options are just mediocre.

I had two rounds of salad because the selection of items was limited and I rarely get repeats at a buffet. A lot of the food was just not visually appealing, a lot of it looked dry as if it had been sitting for a very long time. 

My friends got a serving of prime rib, it was overcooked, tough and dry unfortunately.

The desert bar was good, I did get my fill of Gelato and cupcakes :) I forgot to snag some cotton candy to take home as I had thought about previously. However they were not making it and you know out of sight out of mind. They have the cotton candy machine there however they are not really making it unless someone request it. They have plastic bags so I don't understand why they don't make a few bags for people to pick up. 

Word of advice, if you don't plan on getting your fill of crab legs on your visit then go to a different buffet as there is simply not enough of a selection to be able to get your fill or moneys worth. 

Anyhow the crab legs and dessert made my night, everything in between is just a plain and simple blur. It was a real treat and I enjoyed the experience with my friends.

Well to be straight up and direct my only reason for visiting this buffet is for the crab legs. The crab legs are always the Star and winner of the grub session at this buffet. Also my friend and crab legs eating buddy really enjoys the additional and optional add on for unlimited beer, wine and champagne (9.99). She can go through two or three damn bottles of white zinfandel in one sitting. I have tried doing the unlimited beer and wine just once, but it is just too much to eat and drink like that. I can eat a lot but not on a belly full of alcohol, hell no. 

The buffet is small, really not a whole lot of other options of food items. They need to switch up their items, it is the same buffet line every time. I pretty much know in advance exactly what I will be consuming. No surprise as to what will be available at the buffet. I mean come on, think of us locals that visit on a regular basis.

It's all about the crab legs, I feel like a crab leg whore with every plate I devour.

Went for Sunday brunch so they actually had breakfast AND lunch items fully stocked. I wasn't totally impressed by any of the entree items, but hubby loaded up on the seafood and sushi, so i think we got our money's worth at least.

The sushi (according to him) was pretty darn good, especially for a buffet. It seemed quite fresh still and tasted pretty good. I had a Philadelphia roll that was good. The crab legs seemed small, they had UNPEELED cocktail shrimp...which was not fun to watch my husband peel while I was eating, they also had crayfish, which grossed me out, but I'm sure some people would really enjoy.

The ""buttered carrots"" were in some sort of gross, honey butter sauce and weren't cooked all the way. But the mashed potatoes and cooked cauliflower were super yummy. Didn't try the taco bar or pasta station, the salad bar was a bit lacking. 

The desserts were plentiful and some were really tasty and some were just blah. The highlights were the cotton candy and the gelato! The raspberry gelato was the perfect ending!

All in all, if I had paid $50 I would've been super unhappy, but it was a good value at half off, even though they cleared all of our table off completely before we got back with dessert. (They had to get us new drinks and napkins and silverware, which cost them a few bucks off their tip in the end.), Sunday ""champagne"" brunch...never offered cgampagne, but saw people with it.

When in Vegas my friends and I make it a point to check out one of the buffets. 

The hotel we were staying at offered a coupon for this place making this less than $20 a person so we ended up going to two buffets this trip (highly NOT recommended unless you can control your portions).

The food is extremely dry (even their pasta?!) and very lacking in flavor. It tasted like everything had been sitting out for hours. Not fresh at all...and it was lunch time! My friends always joke about coming here, that's how terrible it was...to me food is no joke so I don't even =p

Luckily for us we got here a little before 4pm so were charged lunch prices.  You just end up staying for an hour or more and they start bringing out the dinner foods.  Unfortunately since it was around the holidays, prices were more expensive than they normally were.  Since we came between lunch and dinner there was no wait.

The selection of food here is pretty typical.  They have a meat station with prime rib, turkey, ham, and rotisserie chicken.  The sushi station is pretty miserable...just a few rolls that looked gross so I didn't even try it.  Their Italian section has some good pastas and lasagna.  The best were the meatballs...so yum!  They also have a chinese station with rice, chow mein, wontons, etc.  Surprisingly there was still breakfast selections as well with eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.  I don't bother touching salad at a buffet...gotta get your money's worth and only amateurs fill up on salad.

The best part is the shrimp cocktail...shrimp were a decent size.  They also brought out crab legs later for dinner but I was already kinda full by then.

Desserts are decent.  They have a gelato bar.  I tried the tiramisu flavor which was way too sweet but the mint chocolate flavor was much better.  The chocolate cake was also good but a little on the sweet side.

I had a couple of comps for the ""Buffet of Buffets"" that were about to expire.  Even though we pretty much only do buffets when friends and family visit, we could not let these babies expire without using them.  The line for Paris and Planet Hollywood's buffets were over an hour long when I called so we ended up here.  No line!  No surprise.  

We were last here 5 years ago and not much has changed.  The most significant thing was that they got rid of their chocolate fountain and now give out bags of cotton candy.  The best things were the crab legs which were larger and tastier than the ones at the Rio we had a day later.  I also liked the carving station and the dessert area so we mainly just filled up on those.  The salad, Mexican and Asian stations were all mixed bags.  I heard the mashed potatoes were great....

A family of 5 sitting next to us were already on dessert and as we were about to leave, the father got up to speak to the manager to complain about the pasta being cold.  He said it ruined their dinner so the manager fully refunded them!  They were already on dessert!!!

I was so hungry and didn't feel like walking back to Mirage or Treasure Island, both of which have great food, excellent service, and reasonable prices. So in  a rush to get some food I settled for Flavors. Wow! What a mistake. 

Upon walking up to the cashier to pay for my meal, all three cashier continued their conversation, looking at me, saying nothing to me, and talking for over 2 minutes. Finally I said ""can I pay here to eat in this buffet"" and they looked at me liked I had stolen their kid. Isn't the cashier at the buffet suppose to take your money. And from here it only gets worse.

The hostess seats me at table next to a 80 year old man that has no respect for the space around him, or himself. The piled plates, the newspapers scattered around his table, and the booth on both side of him covered in his thrown about newspapers. The hostess tells me to sit and leaves all the newspaper on my seat. I looked at her like she was crazy and she pushed the papers slightly for my butt to have a clear space. 

From here... oh god, the food is disgusting. Fat and grizzle in the roast beef so bad you can't chew it. Old crusted over foods, and empty containers of food everywhere. 

After I sit down and eat my food I finish my soda, I say to the waitress can you please get me a diet coke and water. She snaps back...""this isn't my section, I am off."" Now she is clearing tables, and is dressed like all the other servers, and she is the only one in my area. So I say..""can you please find the person who is working I would like a diet coke and water."" She says, ""let me see what I can do.""

A trip to get a wilted salad and over 10 minutes later I still have no soda. So I ask to see the manager. This buffet was $28. I have no problem with paying $28 to get a decent meal and decent service. Flavors is far from decent anything.

It wasn't the most expensive dinner buffet on the strip but we did pay $35 each. I think the awful waitress we had may have skewed our opinion a bit but the food was barely average at best. The waitress greeted us to take our drink order and we both ordered a Coke. She asked us how thirsty we were because if we were thirsty, she wanted to bring us each two glasses because she didn't want to have to make extra trips back to our table just to bring us another drink. I could possibly understand if the restaurant was slammed but there was so many empty tables and she had plenty of time to lean against the waitress station to chat with other waiters and text on her phone.
I can't think of any one thing we tried that was worth raving about. As I said earlier, it was average at best but there were several things the we tried that remained on our plate as we went to try something else. We do love Vegas buffets but there are far more to choose from at this price or less that make Flavors not worth the time or money.

We went for Sunday brunch and the line was maybe 10-15 minutes long, not too bad.  It cost approx. $25 but we had a coupon for $5 off per person.  Good thing too, because the food here was definitely not worth $25.  

At first glance the buffet seemed pretty decent.  It had a little bit of everything: traditional American breakfast foods (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc), Mexican (Spanish rice, tacos), Asian (sushi, dim sum, chow mein) and prime rib and fried chicken and salads and dessert items.  I loaded up my plate with just about everything and sat down to enjoy.

The first sign that this place sucked was that the scrambled eggs were God awful.  It didn't even taste like eggs.  It was like greasy yellow mush with a slight salty flavor.  C'mon how hard is it to screw up eggs?  All I could eat were a couple bites.  I moved on to the bacon and sausage and they were overcooked and really really really salty.  The prime rib had absolutely no taste to it, even with the very generous amount of au jus I put on it.  The Spanish rice was very undercooked and seemed like little pebbles.  The sushi was just plain disgusting, there were no other words to describe it.  I also couldn't find any soy sauce anywhere, no matter where I looked.  I had to ask a worker and he brought me one.  I don't understand why they didn't keep one next to the sushi area.

Finally, I just threw up my hands in despair and went to get a donut.  A plain, glazed donut.  I figured they probably weren't cooked on the premises so it had a better chance of being pretty decent.  Unfortunately, Flavors Buffet managed to mess up the donut too.  It was stale.

For this price, we rate the overall restaurant a 4 star. I had read some of the other reviews before going and I was just a little worried with how our experience would go but for the price, we figured we could give it a shot. 

When we first arrived, we were not very impressed- the ladies at the front were not the nicest and certainly not welcoming (almost felt unwelcome) so I was kinda worried we were going to have a bad experience. However, Abba took us to our seats and she was very nice. Our server was Phoung: she was INCREDIBLE! We were so impressed with her service, we NEVER ran out of drinks and she was so attentive. 

 The food is not bad, especially for a buffet but that's what you have to realize, it's a buffet (quantity vs. quality), I have definitely had worse for buffets. I would probably give the food 3.5 stars overall (but the mexican food was pretty good-especially the quesadillas) and they have a pretty good selection. For the price we paid, we really just couldn't complain, but I don't think I would pay $70 to go there again.

 Flavors is a great place to satisfy any appetite and features continuous live cooking stations, freshly prepared seafood, all-you-can-eat crab legs and fresh cut Prime Rib, an array of delectable side dishes, traditional comfort foods and a variety of pastries prepared to perfection.


 Flavors represents cuisines from around the world, including Churrasco (Brazilian BBQ), sumptuous pizzas and Italian casseroles prepared in a wood burning oven, fire-roasted rotisserie chicken, piping hot steamed crab legs and tasty Asian selections such as hand rolled-sushi, Maki Rolls and homemade wonton soup as well as traditional Southwestern dishes. Flavors is one of the most diverse buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. For dessert, Flavors features a gelato station with homemade sorbet, gelato and ice cream.

Went around the buffet with my plate to see what kind of selection they had...

Stale lettuce and dried out cut veggies at the salad bar was the welcoming committee for this buffet for me. Followed by thick and chunky, been left out a LONG time and was beginning to develop a skin like uncovered pudding salad dressing.

Oh this has to get better I told myself.

Nope.

Dried food on the counters, food on the floor and unpleasant smells no matter which way I turned.

I remembered the buffet being yummy with lots of options and most importantly AFFORDABLE.

So when my brother and I ventured over to Vegas for a turn-around trip, I suggested we hit up this buffet to stuff our faces so full that we wouldn't even consider spending money on food for the rest of the trip. 

The food wasn't as good as I remembered but it still did what it was supposed to do... fill us to the brim.

We only made it 3 plates in before noticing a new addition to the buffet service... the option for unlimited alcoholic drinks for only $9.99 per person!

The unlimited drinks option includes domestic bottled beer, mimosas, bloody mary's and wine. It is available all day. So really, if you committed, you could buy it for lunch and sit there drinking for 5-6 hours. 

I only wish this deal was available without the purchase of the buffet because OH MY GOD... we were sooooooo full after eating and then drinking 6 mimosas each in 45 minutes.

We had stopped into the buffet with 1.5 hours until it closed. The first half hour was spent getting food, eating food, losing our table in the sea of tables, arguing with the waitress because I thought our table had disappeared, getting food, eating food. The final 45 minutes of our time in the restaurant was spent chugging mimosas.

I'm not sure if you have ever tried to chug mimosas, but it is not easy. The carbonation really starts to catch up to you. The first two went down easily. The second two took a little more effort. We started stirring the mimosas before drinking them to make them a little less filling and bubbly. The fifth was a challenge and required some inappropriate pre-drink belching to clear space. The final drink was downright painful. Our bellies were full of food, alcohol and carbonation. I was very surprised that the final mimosa didn't shoot right back out of my mouth for lack of space. 

Our discomfort and over-consumption would not have been possible without a very attentive server who completely understood our goal. The mimosas were stronger each time and he was beating us to the punch by delivering our next mimosa as soon as we finished the previous. He even gave us two final mimosas that we just couldn't finish so we gave them to the neighboring table. 
We left the buffet clutching our stomachs and waddling a little. But we were happy and a little buzzed.

So long story short; if you go to this buffet, are of legal drinking age and want to challenge yourself with unlimited drinks... show up earlier so you can take your sweet time. The food is good and isn't expensive but the unlimited drink deal is even better. Go Harrah's!

(That's what Vegas is about, right?) It was rated 4.5 stars, and was supposed to be a good place to grab breakfast. (I figured there should be a better 24-hour breakfast spot on the strip, considering it's Vegas and the place is all about gambling/partying into the wee hours of the morning. I was hoping that's what this was going to be.) Man oh man, was I disappointed!

Going to the address on that ""Buffet of Buffets"" listing actually brought us to Flavors. So, I'm rating Flavors, and I'm going to go ahead and forgive that my expectations of finding a decent breakfast at 4pm might've been a little unrealistic. (Hey, I still think that'd be an attractive destination for a lot of people. A 24-hour version of San Jose's Bill's Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-san-jose) would knock the socks off of folks seeking a late breakfast on the strip.)

Here's what I found at Flavors. (Granted, it was 4pm on a Thursday. You may get better results at a busier time, but it wasn't an interesting enough place for me to bother giving it a second shot.)
* Waited 6 to 8 minutes to be seated -- place was not busy and no one in front of us in line. Could've seated ourselves...
* Lots of the food was way under temp. I'd say just about everything I tried except the soup were lukewarm and probably a food poisoning incident waiting to happen.
* Cheese ravioli -- might've been good if not cold.
* Penne pasta with alfredo sauce -- might've been good if not cold.
* Italian sausage and kielbasa were OK but lukewarm. Would've been tasty if it were hot. But nothing special here.
* Egg drop soup -- the base was unimpressive and did not seem very authentic, but they absolutely sank the ship by putting veggies in it that gave me the impression of Veg-All.
* Sushi/seafood I didn't dare touch after finding how poor a state the hot dishes were in.
* Fruit was OK but not a good selection (all they had was honeydew and grapefruit wedges).
* Every type of bread I could find was stale/hard/dried out like it'd been sitting out too long. (The corn bread and dinner rolls both had this problem.)
* Coffee was acceptable and, thankfully, nice and hot.
* Had some vanilla ice cream for dessert. Had to ask the attendant behind the counter to scoop it, but that was OK, and she was very nice. Unfortunately the ice cream was the one part of my meal I really enjoyed.

Overall, the food not being maintained at sufficient temperature just killed this place for me. The price and service didn't do anything to redeem it.

Visited on a Friday evening around 9pm when you would think a buffet would be at its best since the dishes are being refreshed frequently, but if this was Flavors at its best I shudder to think of what its like at its worst.

The crab legs were suprisingly good for a buffet, especially considering the quality that you get on the rest of the buffet.  Desserts were undoubtedly the highlight.  Small portions so you can try multiple offerings, and every single one of them was great.  Plus the gelato station was a great touch.  

Nothing else on the buffet was even restaurant quality.  There are Italian, Asian, Mexican, and traditional American sections, plus a salad bar, and I tried a bit off of each section and there's not one thing that would have been acceptable if you ordered it at a restaurant.  Even the low tier buffet chains around the US like Golden Corral, Ryan's, Furr's, etc crank out better food than this.

Service was ok.  Great on refilling drinks but it took a while for used plates to be cleared.

If you're getting comped or gluttony is your thing then go for it.  Or check your insulin level at the door and splurge on nothing but dessert.  Otherwise stay away.  It's terrible., nan",Scott,22,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

None of the food was very good.  We got to go in the special door since my uncle has a high level in the club.  Of course, there were other people in the line in front of us who should have gone to the regular line but the cashier took care of them anyway.  I guess that is good customer service.

We got a table right by the buffet which was nice.  There are tons of options available on the buffet but nothing was superb.  Clam chowder was really the only thing that I thought was really good.  Everything else was just ok.  Crab legs were old and hard to break open.  Salad bar options were lacking.  Hot stuff was just okay.  Desserts were just okay too.

Well, my wife and I were tired with glazed-over eyes from jet lag and too much slot play, and seeing we were playing at Harrah's we decided what the hey, let's go! Yet again we were underwhelmed by this buffet. I do like the fact that they ask you when you pay what you want to drink as it means you don't have to sit down and wait for the waitress to come before heading up to grab your first plate of slop, but that's where the compliments end. The rolls were hard, the salad bar doesn't offer a whole heck of a lot, the shrimp is peel and eat (come on!), and...and...ok their fried chicken was pretty decent.

Service still stunk like the last time...our waitress would run away for 5-10 minutes at a time (where she went nobody knows...was she at the craps table?). I left nary a dollar for her as her apathetic attitude made me sad inside. 

If you're hungry and want to eat quantity over quality, this is your place. Or if you like fried chicken as it wasn't half-bad.

I was thinking it might be all kinds of awesome sauce since the line snaked out to a solid 20 min wait. Weird thing is they weren't even filled to capacity inside. I'm thinking this may be nothing more than a clever ploy to make people think there's greater demand than in reality. 

Of course, I could also just be reading into things way too much. 

A dinner for one adult is $25, which is a decent price if you're planning to seriously gorge yourself until your stomach hates you. The theme to this buffet is that all the major cultures are represented, so you can dine on Mexican, Chinese, Italian... whatever you want. 

The hit of the night was the endless crab legs. I think they were billed as King Crab legs, but these must have come from a midget king because they were small and tiny, like T Rex arms. I still loaded my plate with enough to feed three people. 

Everything else was of varying quality. The Italian fare had some passable sausage & peppers. The pastas were OK. 

I grabbed some beef curry from the Chinese section, but the rest of their offerings made Panda Express look high end. 

There was a dude cutting up prime rib who looked like he would rather drown himself in au jus than continue slicing meat for one minute longer. It's always fun to pick out the employees in Vegas whose faces spell out a lifetime of internal misery from dealing with jackass tourists. 

They had bananas foster for dessert. Well, actually they have something like 30 different desserts, but one bite of that and I got instant tunnel vision. At least if I'm going to stuff my remaining pockets of space with food, it's a fruit. Sort of.

Lunch and Dinner are VASTLY different, and it really isn't just about the food.

We did the Buffet of Buffets (See details in my Le Village Review), and we had lunch and dinner here. Both times we added on the all you can drink for 10.00 (Includes beer, wine and champagne). 

At lunch time we get sat down in Rudy's area (Ask for him if you can he is AMAZING). I would have my champagne glass in my hand and he would fill in on the way to my mouth it was almost a game to see if he could keep my glass full, and boy did I try to beat him. He had my friend at one point with 3 alcoholic drinks in front of her. 

We never had to ask for a drink unless we wanted something different like wine instead of beer etc. 

The food was amazing, they had wood fire chicken, prime rib and pork. It smelled like a camp fire it was amazing. They also had cotton candy. I have never seen that at a buffet but it was AWESOME.


We went about our day and came back for dinner. Sadly Rudy only works the lunch shift till 3pm.

The food was still good, sadly the cotton candy was gone for the evening. However, we started with a female drink waiter. She was abrupt and very inattentive. I assume it was because it was the end of her shift because after she brought our first drinks we never saw her again. We had to flag down a gentleman that was in the area and after that he server our drinks and was pretty decent but we had to flag him down repeatedly and he didn't come over to the table just to check on us. I can see where this Buffet has a low rating due to service, but the food and my experience at lunch was good enough for me to warrant 4 stars., nan",Trish,159,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, it was all I got. =)))

Of course I consulted Yelp before heading to the Flavors buffet! It had good reviews and decent pricing so we checked it out! My friend knew of my crab legs addiction so when he saw one diner with crab legs on his plate, he told me about it and I made a beeline for my precious crab legs.  I cracked my first one and dipped it in the butter sauce and I was in heaven! It was so huge, so juice and soooo yummy!  Prolly the task of getting the meat out in one big piece and actually being successful at it adds up to my enjoyment.

If the rest of the buffet was good, I'd never know but I still give them 4 stars because of the reaction of everybody else on my table and mainly my happy crab leg-filled tummy.  As I sat there devouring my crab legs, they've gone on at least 2-3 trips back to the buffet and they made really good comments on the ribs, grilled meat and sausages.

There was one incident that made me upset. 

A Spanish family walked in just in time before 10 pm, and seemed to have special treatment with the Latino staff. Their teenage daughter (tall, beautiful, and skinny) walks to the gelato place, and the server, being Latino, puts on a big smile and offers her samples and a cone. 
I, being Asian and Mexican (but just by looking at me, I look Asian) go up and ask to try a sample, and he says, ""I don't have anything for that."" My father picked up one of the spoons he used for the other girl and handed it to him to use. The server ROLLS HIS EYES and starts giving us attitude.

On Thursday night, which was my final night at Vegas, I won $574 in a slot machine at Flamingo. I wasn't planning to have breakfast the following day when I checked out. However I decided to get breakfast for the following reasons: 1) I got a coupon for $5 off for breakfast as a Total Rewards Member 2) Instead of gambling I still can get points by eating here.

After the first plate I lost my appetite. Here's why. The first plate included scrambled eggs. I like my scrambled eggs wet but something was wrong with these eggs. They left a bad taste in my mouth and stomach. Gordon Ramsay said he could tell if a person can cook well if it knows how to cook scrambled eggs. Well someone should've vetted the person or people who cooked theses scrambled eggs. I ended only have three plates of dishes because of the scrambled eggs. The rest of the items were pretty good like ham, sausages, hash brown, and blue berry pancakes. But I always felt to determine how good a breakfast buffet is by how well cooked are the scrambled eggs. 

My advice is if you won big money from the slot machine I suggest skip this place and treat yourself to a higher quality restaurant., nan",Gerald,267,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

No, they don't. There is no caramelized sugar to CRACK on your freakin creme brullee, they told me ""well there is caramel on the bottom""

- You have the 24 hr BUFFET pass...and are (a) craving fruits OR (b) want to drink until you drop on bottomless cheap beers [Coors/Miller Light] or house wine [ask] for a price of $10...without hitting the casino/clubs/pubs/7-11

As for all else:
- the food is SUB-PAR...and as expected [ie: clams & mussels are...UGH, a disaster; prime rib is at its RUBBER prime...and the New York strip...is as hard as the New York Brick that makes up Wall Street; Mexican food section looks and tastes like it was rummaged out of a trashcan - SERIOUSLY]
- can't say much about service when you're a platinum/diamond holder; but by observing other tables...they are pretty nice!
- OH YEAH, while normal guests have the cold crab legs, Platinum/Diamond section gets STEAMED crab legs, which, IMHO, are a LOT better

Ambiance:
- lots and lots and LOTS of elderly people (I'd say that's a good thing if the food was GREAT because the lines to any great items would be SHORT)...BUT as mentioned earlier, the food is pretty much sub-par., nan",Jireh,337,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

He wanted to go to a buffet in a bad way.  We were right by Harrah's, so against my better judgement, that's where we ended up.  Let's just say $22 a head was outragious for what was offered.

First, I was hungry.  Second, I wasn't expecting much, but thought I could eat just about everything.  Nothing looked appetizing to me, even through my beer goggles.  Everything looked old, the place was kind of depressing.  I wouldn't think anyone would really consider ending up here, but if for some reason you are - please think again.

Went to the buffet at 8:10am and no line/no wait. Food was fresh, good fruit, selection of breakfast sausages and bacon. Your typical breakfast food. Bakery section, Asian section w/some pork buns, Mexican section w/eggs n chorizo, tortillas, salsas.. And other sections I can't remember.

I have had both the breakfast and seafood dinner at Flavors and both experiences were remotely the same good food but poor service. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast selection which contained all the essential breakfast items and a few extras. At $16 dollars a person the price was comparable to any other breakfast buffet or a plate at your average eatery. 

Honestly, the problem was with our server who was rude, inattentive, and down right nasty. She totally ignored my table. She went around our area refilling just about everyone's glasses and checking on everyone but, my table. She would look in our direction then walk away. 

Again no problem with the food so I ventured back last Friday evening for dinner. I loved it! Succulent crab legs and cotton candy are defiently a win. However, a larger selection would have been nice. I also noticed the absence of fresh fruit besides bananas and honeydew melon. 

As before the problem was with the service. My server I believe her name was Jennifer was amazing. The problem this time was with our hostess who seated directly in the middle of the dinning room surrounding plenty of foot traffic.

Its stations include salad, seafood, Italian, Asian, Mexican, pizza, pasta, and desserts - complete with gelato, tiny tarts, and a chocolate fountain. I'm probably forgetting some type of food, but I hope you get the picture - an amazingly vast array of choices - even for a buffet.

For my first plate, I marched right up to the prime rib station and asked for a slice. I got it with the horseradish sauce - strong but in a good way - along with broccoli, a couple of red potatoes, and a piece of maki sushi from the Asian station nearby for my walk back to the table.  

The service was great. Our waiter was very experienced, once holding a tray of dirty dishes, probably amounting to almost 20. He joked with my mom denying her a change in beverage choice from iced tea to coffee, and we almost fell for it. When my Oma asked for a wet nap, he brought a small handful and knowingly said she could take them in her purse. Of course, the man serving the prime rib was friendly. The second time I came up and got less horseradish sauce, he jokingly gave me a hard time about not taking more. Even one of the other diners encouraged me to take more food at the seafood section. Hesitant about how many crab legs or shrimp to take, I got his support in thinking that I could finish it.

Not even out of fear of judgment but more to save you the details, I'm not going to attempt to list everything I ate at this buffet. Basically, the variety and service impressed me., nan",Jackie,226,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

But, this did not really matter as the food tasted like left-overs.  The food was stale, cold when supposed to be hot, and / or over-cooked.  We tried to complain to the manager.  She basically said ""too bad"".  When she tried to give us a free buffet ticket, I refused stating it was a conflict of interest.  She go upset about that and stormed off!  

The place, like Harrah's in general, has really gone down-hill over the years.  I went to Palace Station and ate their buffet (which you would expect to be mediocre...and it is) but even the Palace Station buffet was better than Flavors.  Skip this buffet!

If you bought the 24-hour pass, go to Planet Hollywood (good but has gone down as well) or Paris.  Rio is always good.  Or, just save your money, go one block East from the Strip and go to Ellis Island Casino on Koval Lane and get a New York steak dinner and a great beer for $9.

I have been here twice now and both times I have left very pleased with the service and the food. This buffet is located in the not so popular Harrahs hotel and casino that is close to the heart of the strip. Also this buffet is included on the all you can eat 24 hour buffet that Caesar's entertainment offers. So let the review begin.

The first time I had tried this buffet was easily the best service I have ever received at any food establishment. So good in fact that I had to hunt down a spot on Caesar's website to send them an email praising the server Freddy for his attentiveness, caring, and incredible interest in seeing that we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience. e came to us many times, since we had finished our dinner he brought us some coffee for our dessert. He inquired about our trip and where we were from, then told us about his life and how he ended up in Las Vegas. All of it very nice and non of it intrusive or bothersome. Freddy was top notch. Moving on.

The second time we went was for breakfast so I can compare it directly with the Garden Buffet we had the morning before. Right off the bat it was not nearly as crowded and cluttered. Seating is more traditional buffet, big room lots of tables. The buffet is a long straight wall with key foods strategically placed. You can tell they pay attention to detail. Popular items of food such as eggs and bacon were located at three different spots at the buffet. This keeps the clutter down and not having thirty people waiting in line for the one dish of bacon or whatever. Also they give you a full carafe of coffee,     how perfect is that. No one else does that, no flagging anyone down for more, no waiting for fifteen minutes with an empty cup.

They do have some great items like gelato, donuts, cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, and cotton candy, yes cotton candy you can take for later. The food here is slightly above average, it is good for the lower end buffet that this is, but what puts it over the top and gives it an extra star is their attention to detail and impeccable service. Clearly they pay attention to the people they hire. The food is good, the service is great, the attention to detail is on point, and the location and seating is ideal, what is not to like about this place.

Even at a young age I knew this food model was flawed.... I ate here because it is located in the hotel we are/were staying in. The place is clean and the selection is plentiful. I had the roast beef, prime rib, ham, and mashed potatoes and it was very good: it was cooked properly and it was juicy. My wife had the salad bar and there was a solid selection and everything was fresh and well maintained. I should have stopped, but I thought why not... The shrimp, crab legs, clams, and sushi were all very bad. The crab legs were soggy and lacked meat, while the shrimp was very basic. The sushi rolls were hard and dry and basically fell apart before they hit my lips. Food aside the worst part of the buffet model is some of the people... The types are as follows: 
1. The over eaters - they take a lot and eat most of it. It's a bit troubling to see. 
2. The shover - they can't wait in line and need to shove other people to get to the food. I'm confident these people think the food will run out.

5. The save it for later. Once done gorging on loads of food they take more to go. I watched a women put food in her purse!!!!

If you're staying at one of the ""total rewards"" casinos, look in the coupon book you got from checking into your hotel. We got a $10 off coupon for this buffet-score! 
Being vegetarians who eat fish we were somewhat limited. Actually, we were mainly here for the crab legs. So in that regard-eat your heart out-as we did. The crab legs were good and plentiful and they had legs on ice and hot, take your pick. 
Like I mentioned, there wasn't much else we could eat here, a lot of meat options, but oh the desserts.....
I think they had about 20 varieties of mini cupcakes. My insulin level is rising just remembering this. We got one of each, hey no judgement-it's Vegas, and that way we could share and sample each one. So amazingly delicious. 
So essentially we had crab legs and cupcakes...a nice balanced meal.

Rudy kept our drinks full and the Churrasco Pork was to die for, and the $9.99 all you can drink beer/wine was worth every penny. I would rate it 6 stars if I could.

It was so good, we thought we would come back for dinner. But when we did, it was like we had come to an entirely different establishment. The entire mood and attitude was changed. Trying to get a drink refill was like pulling teeth, eventually the original lady that was supposed to be our server disappeared entirely and another guy pretty much adopted our table since we were calling out to him so often. The cooks were lazier at dinner than at lunch and didn't get anything refilled in a timely manner (particularly the Churrasco pork) and one of them was just plain rude. The 9.99 all you can drink was not as worth it this time as my companions barely got four drinks out of it with all the trouble they had getting served.

Between my six-star lunch experience and my two-star dinner experience, Flavors averages a 4 for on the whole.

Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese)
There was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess. 

Prime Rib was ok. No real complaints there. 
However, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.

They do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good.

We bought the buffet of buffets for a day when we arrived in Vegas at 1 pm on Sunday. 

What I like from this buffet were the crab legs, shrimps, prime rib and the galeto with waffle cone. Actually, this buffet has more taste than Wicked Spoon and Carnival World.

The crab legs were bigger and more meatier here and they actually scored them so you don't have to crack it open with the cracker yourself, how thoughtful of them. The chowmein actually had taste and siu mei was pretty good and warm considering this is Vegas not LA, the prime rib was tasty also. The waffle cone had a little sweetness in it and it was pretty fresh.

So overall it has more taste than the other three buffets I have afore mentioned.

Actually, we went back for lunch before we left Vegas on Wednesday afternoon, but this time they didn't have the crab, so not sure if they only served crab on the weekends or Sunday only.

Although this hotel and buffet might not be as new or fancier than the other hotels and buffets, will I come back to this buffet the next time I visit Vegas? We might actually., nan",Ken,93,"['Buffets', 'Restaurants']",Flavors The Buffet,"Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel & Casino

The heat lamps over the food are really close.  The buffet has metal containers with lids that contain the dumplings.  Sometimes you have to pull on the lid pretty hard to get to the delicious dumplings.  When I yanked on the lid, my hand hit the heat lamp above and I burned my hand.  A little ice from my drink and it was all good.  But don't do what I did.  Just another safety tip from Holly C. Yes, I am clumsy.

Anyway, this was the 4th buffet in the UYE Buffet of Buffets circuit.  It's a nice buffet but lacks the nice view that the Lago and Paradise Garden Buffet have.  The pizza here was very good.  Thin crust, good flavor.  I could have lived without the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza, but otherwise very nice pizza.

The dumplings were also very good, despite the hand burning incident.  They have hot sauce here for the dumplings, which I appreciate. I also enjoyed the gelato.

There is a VIP entrance off to the side for Diamond, Platinum, Seven Stars.  I also think you can buy a line pass here to get into the buffet faster if the line is long.

I don't think this buffet has an all-inclusive champagne option. At least it was not offered.  But it was one of the rare buffets where the servers offered us coffee afterward.  Usually you have to hunt down a server to get it.

We stopped in on Saturday for the Champagne Brunch.  It was $25 per person, but comes with unlimited champagne, which shockingly was not offensive!

Crab Legs: I was fortunate to be the first to receive a new tray of crab legs. The crab legs were sweet and although they were steamed, still retained a lot of flavor and were very enjoyable. 

Pizza: Shockingly the kitchen has a wood fired oven. They cook the pizza in this oven and it is very good. Three or four different types of pizza were available (I chose the vegetarian), but it was thin crust and I really can't complain.

Sushi: The sushi here was a challenge. They only serve rolls here and unfortunately the rice was hard, and the fish of inferior quality, stay away from the sushi.

BBQ Pork: Wow, they have some Brazilain style pork that was a little overcooked, but seasoned to perfection. Oh and the sausage was very, very tasty too.  Had I not filled up on crab legs, I would have been all over the pork and sausage.

Dessert: To me the dessert is the real strength here. Tons of different options. I chose to indulge in a waffle cone with gelatti. Awesome way to end the meal!

I wanted to go to what, in my head, is the best buffet in town (Carnival World at the Rio) on Chirstmas Eve of all days. I naively assumed that it wouldn't be THAT crowded, turns out the line for the buffet was almost at the door and the Rio was a total zoo that day. Since we wanted to get the Buffet of Buffets pass anyway, we decided to go to Harrah's since the shuttle stopped right there.......I really should have waited until tomorrow or have taken my chances with Paris or Planet Hollywood. Very disappointing, and not worth it's full price of $25 (which is, shockingly enough, the same as the Rio).

First off, the wait was much longer than expected, and it was largely because the line to get seated was almost as long as the line to pay. I understand that this was a very busy night, but we could see loads of open tables from where we were standing.

Secondly, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A CHINESE SECTION WITHOUT EGG ROLLS? SERIOUSLY. 

The only above average items in the buffet were the desserts (I know, everyone raves about the crab legs at this buffet, but the line for crab legs never seemed to end so I decided to skip it). 2 interesting things to note about this buffet are that they make and serve cotton candy and they are one of the few buffets in town to serve ice cream and/or gelato in waffle cones. You are also allowed to leave the buffet with them. I think I ate more sugar at this buffet than anything as everything else was so mediocre. 

It's also quite possibly the most oxymoronic buffet in town. How are you going to have international stations and yet not even the basics of that cuisine are available (see: egg rolls for the Chinese section and tamales for the Mexican section). Thank god we grabbed the Buffet of Buffets deal, so at least we can easily make up for this disappointment.

People just kept walking up one after the other that were diamond members so they skipped right past us. It just really made us feel low class getting passed over for at least 30 minutes. 
    The food was ehhh... okay. At best. Compared to Planet Hollywood and Paris it was about McDonalds quality. Not much selection and the desserts were behind a counter so you had to ask for each thing making us feel like we had to settle for just one or two items.
    The service was AWFUL!! I overheard the hostess say to the server that she will have to stop seating because the two servers couldn't keep up at all. We didn't get our drinks for at least 15 minutes and then never got a refill. There was a bus person that got plates once the whole time we were there.

We made out way over and while it looked busy, there wasn't a long wait to order or pick up our food. I decided to try the beef n cheddar and fries and my friend had a chili dog. Our food was ready after not too long and we grabbed a table and dug in. Unfortunately, the fries and lemonade far outshone the sandwich. It looked and tasted as though it had been preprepared and was sitting in a warmer. It was warm, not hot, and there was little cheddar to be found. My friend was equally unimpressed with his hot dog. For the price though, it wasn't a total rip off. On our way out, I grabbed a chocolate cake shake and he got a strawberry shortcake. Those definitely redeemed our experience and I loved the shake.

I mean, I really do like it (I'm giving it 4 stars), but it's not what I was expecting. I had heard SO MUCH about Portillo's before going, but despite that I didn't realize it's basically glorified fast food (and I don't mean that in a bad way at all). For some reason I thought it was more like casual dining.

Anyway, I've been here a few times since I recently started going to a new doctor in this area & I've really liked what I've had. I will say, I got things that probably aren't the most popular items, which actually probably speaks to how good this place is (my dad always gets the chili cheese dogs w/grilled onions & LOVES them). I've had the chicken tenders, grilled chicken sandwich, and beef on a croissant, all of which were yummy. I also LOVE the cheese fries. The fries are crinkly & I like that cheese is on the side. I also tried the chocolate cake & brought home the strawberry shortcake on my last visit. The chocolate cake was VERY rich, but it was a huge slice. I really LOVED the Italian style shortcake, though.  

This place is a really weird place to dine in at. I do like that they are kind of old school when you place your orders. They write it down as you order and call it out to the back over a microphone before ringing it up. I think this makes for less mistakes, especially on orders that aren't as exactly as the item(s) are on the menu. However, I do wish they had a soda fountain where you could serve yourself. It's nice to grab your drink immediately while waiting for your order (it also makes it easier for refills). They also serve you your food here as if everything is takeout (bagged up) whether your dining in or not. It's not a big deal, but it seems like kind of a waste to bag up food, rather than just place it on a tray if your gonna dine-in.

The few times I've been here have always been late afternoons (right after the lunch crowd), and although things have been pretty busy the wait to order & for food isn't bad. From what I understand though this place gets PACKED at peak hours. 

All in all I really like Portillo's, and think it's a good, ""different"" fast food place to stop by and grab a bite to eat at when in this area., nan",George,395,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

I checked out the grand opening, and after a solid wait in line (I'll post pics), I enjoyed some of the best food in Chicago right here in Arizona! I'm completely stoked that Dick decided to open a couple of locations here. 

On the menu for me during their first day was an Italian beef, with hot and sweet peppers, and cheese fries. Their beef is now the leader of the pack in AZ. You'll be hard-pressed to find a better one out here. It's juicy, it's savory, and it's a bit messy (I had that beautiful staff dip mine to really exemplify that latter description). As for the fries, they're perfecto...just like home, and they're even better with a cup of ooey gooey cheese sauce.

Moving out to AZ, I was sad that I'd only get my Portillo's fix when I flew back to visit family. So when one opened in Scottsdale, I was all over it. 
I've been quite a few times at this point. 

Hot dog - pretty much as expected. Hasn't let me down. 
Chili - gross. I seriously don't know what happened, but it's thicker somehow and lacking something. I tested on my last trip to IL, and it hadn't changed there. It's just bad here. 
Fries - hard to mess up. My go-to side. 
Onion rings - gross. Super hard, oddly sweet, nothing special. 

I use to love the strawberry smoothie, but that's not served here. I did try the chocolate cake shake for the very first time a few days ago and was mightily impressed. I'd never had it before, so I can't compare to IL. While it falls short in a few things, my kids and I have made this our after-zoo spot.

My first review of Portillo's got removed by Yelp HQ...something I said about their Italian sausage resembling a d^#k they didn't care for, I guess.

Phallic shaped foods in my book are simply the best.
They're fun to eat.
They're also fun to dangle, pretend suck, angrily bite, and wave around when no-one is looking except your wife. 

Their Italian sausage sandwich is delicious with its hint of fennel and anise flavoring, a must in any good Italian sausage. 
Their all beef hot dog is good too. Nice and flimsy, and long too, good for waving around, signaling your naughty intentions for later. 

The fries, onion rings and shakes are all pretty decent.

The building looks like a diner out of the 50's.  Inside, the place is decorated in a super cute way with lots of interesting signs.  They play oldies music and have ample seating.  Outdoor seating is available too and they have umbrellas to keep you cool and heaters outside to keep you warm.  Ordering is quick and the pricing is very fair!

What I really loved about Portillo's was the Italian Beef sandwich with mozzarella.  OMG, THE BEST BEEF SANDWICH IN TOWN.  They put what they call gravy (I call au jus) on the bread and it makes the bread it so soft.  I ordered cheese fries and the fries are crinkle fries with a cup of cheese on the side.  Very tasty!  We had the onion rings too and they were a little hard but still good.  They have great hot dogs, so says my husband.  Will have to try them at some point.

The have the best Italian Strawberry Shortcake I have ever had....okay technically it is my first ""Italian"" strawberry shortcake.  I have had lots of strawberry shortcake in my day and this was the best.  They sell a portion big enough for 2 for a little over $4.00.

Even though the restaurant was busy, there were two lines with an employee at each line taking orders. We were overwhelmed at how fast we made it to the front of the line. My wife and I ordered a Hot Dog (Chicago Style) each, split an Italian Beef sandwich with sweet pickles and I ordered a large milkshake.

NOTE: They ask if you want sweet or hot peppers which implies that it comes with it, but it's 50 cents more. So if you don't want any peppers, tell them 'NONE'.

We paid for our meal and was given a receipt with our order number on it. In ten minutes, they called our order.
Opening the Italian Beef sandwich was messy and greasy with so-so flavor. My wife's hot dog was also greasy but my hot dog wasn't. The 'dogs' where okay, but I'm going to try Sonic's foot long Chicago dog to see if there is any difference.

When I arrived the line started only a few feet inside the door (that's what I get for going there at lunch time).  The drive through line had over 12 cars in it.  At this time I almost abandoned my lunch from here.  I'm glad I didn't.  From walk-in to walk-out was only 15 minutes.  If you never been there, they take the orders at the back of the restaurant.

We were handed a menu when we walked in, as we got close to the register our orders were written onto a bag so all we had to do was hand it to the person at the register.  We were then directed to the pickup counter and given a number.

I can't say how many people we in front of us, it was a lot, but the staff keep things moving.  There was someone at the front calling out numbers ready for pickup and keeping things moving and most importantly keep people from hanging on the counter while they waited, making those getting their food difficult.  She was very pleasant and interjected humor in all the right places.  

I will admit that I have waited longer at other so called fast food establishments for lower quality food.

And, yet we have another fast food joint, made to be a restaurant, where you have to pick up your own food. 

Note to all restauarnt owners... If I want to pay high prices for food, bring it to me! I don't want to stand in line, I don't want to wait for my name to be called, just bring the damn thing to my table. Hell... Even Carl's Jr. brings your order to where I am sitting.
I'm not lazy. It's just stupid to pay restaurant prices for fast food, in a sense. It's not that often I crave a chili dog.

We met up with a great group of Yelpers for Georgie's UYE. Thankfully, those aforementioned Yelpers had saved us a spot in the INCREDIBLY long line. I mean, seriously...I think I overhead people speaking of their wait time in hours...plural. That's ridiculous. I don't know that I've ever seen people that excited for a hot dog.

While we waited, we witnessed the amazing employees making their way through the crowds (both in the parking lot waiting to get in, as well as the seemingly endless lines of cars making their way through the drive-thru). Portillo's DEFINITELY has their stuff together when it comes to managing the masses. 

After our sojourn through the crowds, we finally made it inside. By this time, we had already chosen our food, and were just waiting to make it to the register. That gave us quite a bit of time to take in the sights. Now, being that I'm not from Chicago, I had to lean heavily on my great company for authenticity. According to the two greatest kings this city has known, Portillo's definitely gets an A+ in that department. Apparently, each Portillo's has it's own special theme. This one has a 50's retro vibe. After all...retro is cool again. Go figure.

As I've mentioned before, I'm not a HUGE fan of hot dogs. They're alright, they're just not my favorite. My wife and I each got the Supreme dog...which we thought would be...I don't know, supreme, I guess. Ultimately, it was sizable, but for something to be called ""supreme"",  I guess I just expected a lot more. It wasn't much bigger than the Ballpark Franks you can buy at the grocery store. It probably didn't help that my hot dog was on a table next to a GARGANTUAN beef sandwich. Talk about buyer's remorse...but, I digress.

For me, the best part of this place was the dessert. We ordered the Chocolate Cake Shake. I thought it would just be a chocolate shake that magically tasted like chocolate cake. Little did I know, they actually take a piece of some of the richest chocolate cake I've ever tasted, mix it with ice cream, and stir it all up. If ever there was a dessert that made me want to immediately get tested for diabetes, this was it. It was SO thick! I ended up having to eat the last bits of it with a spoon. This shake is definitely a game changer!

If you're a Chicago native (which there seem to be a lot of out here), then you'll undoubtedly love this place. If you're a hot dog enthusiast, you'll probably like it, too. If you don't really like hot dogs, then what are you doing here in the first place?

One of my big treats every time I went was a visit to Portillo's for one of their famous Chicago dogs or Italian beef sandwiches. As I got older, I no longer had a reason to travel to Chicago and was missing my Portillo's. Lo and behold, this Portillo's opened up in Phoenix, not too far from where I now frequently vacation in the spring. I was so excited! So, my last trip down I stopped in. Everything was just how I remembered it. The decor and menu hadn't changed one bit. I ordered one of my old standbys--the Italian beef. That, too, had not changed: tender, shaved beef, dipped in flavorful gravy, on a soft roll, and of course topped with the ever-important giardiniera. Sheer perfection. They even offer a package to-go of their beef and gravy, enough for several Italian beef sandwiches. I love this stuff so much I figured out a way to get it all on the plane so I could have more of my beloved Portillo's at home in Seattle.

The chopped salad was in a word DELICIOUS and I was hoping it would be the same way here in AZ. After waiting for a year for this place to open I was not disappointed. The staff was awesome....the drive-thru was fully staffed and not a single person was waiting out there. The outdoor seating is a bit close to the entrance and right next to the drive thru lane so they might want to look into other options with that.

Back to the Chopped Salad.....as I said before just like in Chicago.....they NAILED IT. However the lady that was making them today seem to have trouble with special orders. I ordered 2 chopped salads one with no bacon.....and one with no cheese....she managed to mess that up REALLY. I didn't hold that against her or the establishment because it was opening day...but if it happens in the future they will lose a star on this review.

Word spread like wildfire when Portillo's announced that they were coming to Scottsdale. For months, Valley residents from all around waited anxiously for the doors to open. Just recently, Portillo's doors finally opened. Were they ready for the crowds? Yes they most definitely were! 

I've been to Portillo's in Illinois so I knew what I was in for. This Portillo's lives up to its roots. The exterior is bright and welcoming with tables all around. The drive-thru resembles that of an In & Out (in the ordering sense) and the interior reminds me of a 1950's booming diner. Everything is friendly and welcoming about Portillo's, including the staff. I heard that they brought in around 80 Chicago staffers to manage the launch of the Scottsdale opening which was very smart on their part. We visited tonight and although the line was wrapped around the restaurant, we ordered our food and got it within 15 minutes. What's their secret? Complete organization. While we were waiting in line, someone came up and took our order so that by the time we got to the register, all we had to do was hand them our ticket and pay. After that, we got a number and waited for them to call it. Within 5-7 minutes, they called our number and we were ready to feast! 

The food here is really as tasty as people say it is. It's all about the beef, the Italian beef that is. The beef is juicy, tender and flavorful and sits within a soft roll. The fries are delicious and the Chicago dogs are as good as any. I have yet to try the Chopped Salad or the milkshakes but I hear both are extraordinary so I will be ordering them next time. 

All I can say is, believe the hype and pay a visit to Portillo's. It doesn't matter if you've been to one in Illinois or not.

Portillos is now a chain around the nation, but its origin is very simple back in Chicago.  Seems like all my Chi-town peeps love this place and can't get enough of it.  I always joke why this place has all the hype is because Chi-town folks have big mouths!  LOL -- gotta love my Chicago peeps!  

Needless to say, this place is slamming with patrons salivating to get a taste of a Chicago style hotdog!  The place itself has nostalgic signs hanging from the ceiling and walls.  I gather these are all old school Chicago neighborhoods or Chicago based signage; along with some vintage photography.  Not too easy on the eyes, but whatever!

I ordered the Chicago Style dog of course along with some cheese fries and onion rings.  I also had a taste of their Polish dog too.  I thought the Polish dog was okay at best.  It was just grilled onions on a polish dog and bread -- um okay.  The Chicago style is always my favorite.  Pickles, tomatoes, onions, jalapenos and a hot dog.  You thought I was gonna sing the Big Mac song didn't you!?  Truthfully, I thought the hot dog was okay at best.  I think it was over hyped and you can get this ""Chicago Style"" hot dog anywhere in the valley that sells ""Chicago Style"" hot dogs.  I think it's say that this place was the talk of the town when it first opened and sadly it didn't deliver!  It's like watch Transformer 2 and 3 -- what the heck happened!? 

At the end of the day, I think if you haven't experienced it yet, then I would recommend this place.  However, you're if you're expecting miracles in your palates and the site of a food deity, then please pass on by cause it's not your religion. - Enjoy!, nan",Bao,676,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

We decided to brave the crowds on a Saturday afternoon before a spring training game.  Thanks to an early game we got a good start at Portillo's around 11AM, which I think SOMEWHAT helped with the crowds.  Thankfully we found a parking spot quickly and hurried into the line that was already outside the door.  Inside was PACKED and a bit overwhelming for a person who isn't too keen on crowds.  After placing our order one person in our party stayed in line to pay and two of us looked for a seat.  It took a good 10 minutes walking back and forth to finally get a seat.  People were pushing and shoving the whole time - not fun.

Once we finally were sitting and our food was received, we all calmed down and scarfed our food.  I had a hot dog, which was fab.  I really enjoyed it!  The fries were great as well... only wish we would have gotten more!  The Hubs had an italian beef sandwich and we really liked it.  He got it plain and said next time he wants peppers for sure.

We all really enjoyed the food here, though the crowds were CRAZY!  Not sure it will get any better anytime soon, but perhaps in the future when I am brave again we will give this place a second go around.  For now, I will wait to see if the masses die down....

There are like a gazillion transplants from Chicago out here in AZ, so they have 2 of them.  After reading his review, it made me realize that the last time I was there (Buena Park), I left a bit disappointed.  I wanted to go see a movie that was close by, so I decided to stop and get some lunch.  Redemption?  Yes!

I got there early at like 10:40am.  There were maybe 5 other people in the joint.  I walked up and placed my order for a Jumbo Dog with mustard, onions and relish, a Maxwell Street Polish, a Large Cheese Fries, and a Large Diet Coke.  My total was just under $12.00.  Not the cheapest lunch, but it was substantial and kept me full most of the day.  I paid the lady my money and then took a seat.  A few minutes later, they called my number and I picked up my order.  Here is how everything tasted...............

Jumbo Hot Dog-  Delicious!  I didn't go full Chicago style on this one.  I'm not the biggest fan of tons of toppings.  Mustard, onion and sometimes relish and I am a happy man.  This dog was great!  It was large, plump and beefy!  It was encased in a soft, steamed poppyseed bun and then topped with mustard, onions and plenty of neon green relish.  I really liked the dog and for the .34 cents more than a regular dog, it is well worth going with the jumbo.  Pretty much a must order every time here.

Maxwell Street Polish-  The last time I had this I was extremely disappointed.  The onions were too watery, the bun was soggy and the sausage didn't taste that great.  This time around it was better than last time, but not as good as it could have been. The caramelized onions they use are plentiful, but they destroy the bun.  They soften it up too fast.  The Polish sausage itself was a bit lacking too.  It wasn't that flavorful and had a weird texture.  They skimped on the mustard too.  I ate the whole thing and it wasn't ""bad"" per say, but give me a Teds Polish any day of the week over this thing.  I doubt I will order it again.  I would get 2 Jumbo Dogs instead.

Large Cheese Fries-  These are probably my favorite thing here!  Whatever it is, their cheese sauce is just fantastic.  Its piping hot, creamy and it sticks to the fries perfectly.  They use a crinkle cut fry here and they are fried and salted nicely.  A quick dunk in the molten cheese and you have yourself a winner.  Their fries are in the same pricing scheme as their dogs.  A small fry is only like .20 cents less than a large.  Why even get a small?  For .20, you get way more fries.

The cashier was friendly and the guy that gave me my food was cheery.  They still aren't my favorite hot dog in AZ (Teds holds a special place in my heart), but a jumbo dog and some cheese fries are a guaranteed winner!

It is an extremely dangerous and yet delicious mouth full of goodness!  You'll be tempted to order one of their DELISH shakes and a side of fries with this, but don't unless you are eating with someone that can call the paramedics in case you get a carb overload... 

The only downer about Portillo's is how they want you to wait at the counter to get your food before sitting down.  This is not how the AZ peeps like to do things.  So they should adjust to their new environment and come up with a better way to get people their food.

Portillo's serves up all your Windy City favorites like Italian beef and Chicago style hot dogs. They also have fries and burgers. For sweet treats, they have various shakes, malts, and desserts.

We shared a big beef, dipped, cheese fries, and a large vanilla shake. The big beef was excellent. The beef and broth had a really nice, rich flavor, and the bread held up well to being dipped in broth. We added sweet peppers and mozzarella, which were both good additions to the sandwich ($.50 extra per topping). As for the fries, rather than putting the cheese on top of the fries, the fries and cheese are supplied separately so that you dip the fries into the cheese. The fries themselves were crisp and crinkle-cut. The shake was huge, and very thick.

While the parking lot is a bit small, the restaurant itself is quite spacious, and we had no problem finding a seat despite it being busy on a Saturday afternoon. 

Our total for a Big Beef with 2 toppings, cheese fries, a large shake, and a small soda was about $17, which isn't too bad considering the amount of food we got. We were both definitely stuffed after eating!

Perhaps I had high expectations from both the Yelp reviews I'd read prior and all of my Chicago friends raving about this institution that they grew up frequenting.  

Unfortunately, I didn't realize that a few weeks after the grand opening, Portillo's would still be a zoo!  It's huge and lines weren't long, so I can't complain about that, there were just tons of people (both patrons and employees) everywhere you turned.  I didn't love the layout either...

I'm usually all about fast casual concepts and ordering at a window, but I hated that there are three different areas to pick up your food.  It varies depending on if you order salads, hot food, and/or dessert.  And you have to wait for your number to be called and then go pick it up from the appropriate window.  It's hard enough to hear your number being called and then it's tough because you have to leave your group to go get your food; hence, not a relaxing start to a meal...

Amongst my group of three, we had a hotdog, a chicken sandwich (the breaded one on the croissant), a bowl of chilli, a barbecue chicken salad, and two large fries (one with cheese and one without).  We also had a lemonade and several bottles of water.  

I will say that prices are very reasonable, and the food was fine -- not amazing though.  I felt like it was a glorified fast food restaurant; nothing to make me rush back, although I am sure I'll eventually make my way back to try some of the other things on the menu.  (The other salads looked good and I hear great things about their desserts).

Again, I wasn't a fan of all of the chaos -- perhaps that will die down eventually?  There were a ton of staff, but none of them were super friendly or helpful.  Guests are supposed to clear their own tables - we learned that when we asked.  

Portillo's doesn't offer a kids' menu (although considering the prices, that's fine), and no refills on drinks either.

It was strange to me, to see a Resturant MONTHS after opening, with drive through lines across the parking lot, and a VERY VERY full dining room. 

We got in line, and I had no idea what I wanted, and didn't have much time to pick because someone with a bag and a pencil pressures you into ordering before you even get to a register. I understand they are trying to speed things up, but when I'm a first timer --- let me look at the menu. 

I ended up ordering a Chili Dog. 

It was great to have glass between us, and the kitchen. It was exciting to watch everything going on and MAN do they have a LOT of employees. Everything seemed to work like clock work. 

I have also decieded my new dream job is to be the girl who calls out the order number!

The people who work here obviously take pride in providing excellent, friendly service. Door greeting, directions, order taking, etc were great, plus an employee held the garbage can open for us! I kept turning to my husband and saying, ""wow, how can they all be this nice?""

We're so excited to find such a tasty, healthy bargain right near our gym!! Feeling like we won the lotto :-), Pepper and eggs on Fridays during Lent!

We got their Italian beef drenched in their sauce, it was AMAZING!! So juicy and messy! We also got their all beef hot dog with no mustard or relish and it was delicious!! I despise hot dogs and I loved their hot dog. I liked it better than the Italian beef. Their fries were perfectly salted and yummy!

I wanted to go for the opening night UYE, but it was just too cold for my thin blood.  So, I waited to go here for a Yelper luncheon.  I met up with  Mike C., Georgie M, Rand H and Marvin A.  Only girl in the group and that was fine by me!  

What an amazingly delicious place.  I left there thinking, I understand the excitement.  What's baffling to me is how a place so big can do, at least, one thing so well.  This was my first time taking a ""dip"" in the Portillo's family of restaurants.  I've been to Chicago plenty, lived in the burbs for a short while, but never heard of Portillo's.  No matter, what I lacked in hearing, I made up for in tasting yesterday.  

Oh yeah... this place has been open about 3 or 4 weeks now and the crowd has yet to die down.  I highly doubt that the crowd will.  At any rate, I get there just before 11am and you can tell by noon the place would be packed.  There was a very short line that I hop in to place my order.  I checked out the menu before I arrive and then I wrote down my order so when it was time to order, I just read off my little piece of paper.  But, to be honest, I don't know where their menu is displayed.  I did try to take a last minute peek to see if I wanted to change my order, but I remember thinking, "" I don't see the menu, just stick to the script.""  I pay and then I wait for my number to be called.  The place is REALLY REALLY LOUD, so you definitely need to pay attention for you number to be called.  

I ordered the half sausage/half beef sandwich - Dipped baby Dipped and with hot and sweet pepper and mozzarella cheese!  What a simply delicious sandwich.  I RARELY eat bread, but I wanted to devour the bread.  the bread was firm, yet soft.  It has a subtle hint of Italian spices that you can definitely taste.  I highly recommend adding the mozzarella cheese for that reason.  I wish I had my sandwich DOUBLE DIPPED!  or more gravy on the side!   I didn't enjoy the sausage, and I would never order that again.

I also ordered the fries.  This is where I kinda got irritated.  YOu can't order a salad for less than 5 dollars there.  I wanted a simple side salad with my sandwich.  I need a reasonable option to make up for the calorie bomb!  But they don't offer a small salad, so I ordered the fries.  Definitely some of the best tasting fries I've had in quite sometime.  The perfect amount of salt with a crisp exterior while hiding the soft warm middle.  

I will definitely go back.  I hope sooner than later., nan",Ursula,265,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

One of those little things are the amazing hot dog and italian beef restaurants all over the city and its sprawling suburbs.  Portillo's not only was one of my favorite of those places, but it was the one that my brother and I would ride our bikes over to so we could get a cheap and delicious lunch before hitting up a movie on a random summer afternoon.  With that kind of nostalgic expectations, Portillo's in Scottsdale had a lot to live up to, and guess what?  They hit the mark with a perfect bullseye.

A jumbo hot dog with everything on it (like a good Chicago place even an Arizona Portillo's knows that means no ketchup unless specifically requested), fries, and a piece of chocolate cake!  The 10 year old me, who ate this meal more times than I can even try to remember, couldn't have been any happier.  The dog is pretty much what I remember loving as a kid.  The bun was a lot soggier than it should be, which resulted in the very fresh condiments falling out, but I can forgive that.  The fries were the perfectly crispy ""crinkly"" fries that the best places always served.  The cake was perfectly moist and scrumptious with the very sweet [and unnecessarily too much] frosting that I couldn't get enough of as a child.  My fiancé had the italian beef.  Awesome.  Make sure to order it dipped.  Messy but flavorful.  She also ordered cheese fries (they just give you a container of some cheese sauce that I couldn't stop dipping my fries into).  By the way; the food is cheap!  All that and two soft drinks was only a little more than $20.00.

The line out the door was expected, and even a little daunting, at 6:30 on the Friday night following the grand opening.  The good news; It moved fast.  We got our food and found a table in a little over a half hour.  If that can be done in the first week, then the pace will certainly speed up when the excitement starts to ware down.  If you're not already a Portillo's fan, you may want to wait a few weeks for the hype to die down before you give the place a try.

I live within 3 miles of this restaurant. I have driven past many times and always wondered what it was about.  when I saw the reviews on yelp I thought it was worth a try.

I ordered it Thai and meet and sausage sandwich... And it was just a big soggy nasty mess. Not very appetizing and not very good at all.

The french fries are like you buy from the store frozen Oreda. They're not well cooked or well seasoned or unique at all.  

The salad bar is a joke... It looks like a mess and not very good options or tasty offerings.

The hamburgers are plain and disgusting. Not much thought no uniqueness. It's not even as good as cooking at home.

The chocolate cake was disgusting.

 People will review saying it's cheap and good... But it's not even cheap. You and up paying nearly 5 bucks for a hamburger and fries. Smash burger is far better for the same money.

I had the Italian beef and a friend had a hot dog.  I regretted not coming back to try a hot dog but, after learning there was a Portillo's in Scottsdale, I figured I'd get one back home.

And I did.  I went here with the same friend. The restaurant's interior looks a lot like the Portillo's in Chicago except it's smaller and newer. This is one of those, walk up to a counter and place your order and then wait until your number is called along with something clever that rhymes with your number, ""43 come and see me"" (the woman in Chicago was much better, the guy in Scottsdale just didn't have his heart in it). You then sit in their large seating area. 

My friend got the Italian beef and I got a jumbo hotdog with everything.  Some comparisons - the Italian beef I got in Chicago was tasty but it was was very wet. I mean, running down your arm when you picked it up wet. The Italian beef here was moist but wasn't dripping.  The hotdog was OK. This was my first Chicago-style dog so maybe I just didn't know what to expect. It's a fat beef hotdog with mustard and there are sliced onions, pickles, peppers, etc just laying in the bun along with the hotdog. It was good, just not what I was used to.  My friend said she preferred the Italian beef over the hotdog she got in Chicago. I concur.

Taking down the restaurant decor for a very open counter service restaurant. Akin to something like Five Guys, you can view the entire line of cooks from grill to tray service along half the perimeter. They even have a separate counter for serving desserts. 

The title suggests hot dogs is the main attraction, but from what everyone's been ordering and what the staff tells me, the Italian beef attracts the most customers. The gravy is excellent, and the beef while succelent embodied all the classic flavors every Italian beef fan loves. The bread does the sandwich justice, but it's good but not great. I personally like the combo, which comes with an entire sausage in addition to the beef.

The sides are not something to shirk at either. The onion rings are super crispy and the crinkle fries work well with dat cheese whiz. 

To top everything off, this entire restaurant even has a drive thru, which totally works!

The menu is huge, so I'm far from exhausting my limit here. I hear the salads are pretty good, and I've got to try the namesake dish eventually. However, it's really hard to stay away from the Italian beef every time I come back., nan",Dave,261,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

Qtro4APUHh1wEwnVhciPPQ,5fu41tfqTU_LONb95t1Dkg,2013-03-23,0.0,0.0,3.0,2.0,"To be honest, the place isn't all it's cracked up to be, and for a few reasons. 

1. Everyone here (and by everyone I mean the customers) are SO bitter! Probably because they have to wait in a 30 minute crowd standing shoulder to shoulder with strangers, but seriously. Everyone is so grumpy and has such an attitude! Normal people turn into vultures hunting and pecking for tables, a spot at the ketchup dispensers, or at the registers and do whatever it takes to get what they want, even at the expense of other diners. It makes the experience a little less pleasant. 

2. The whole place seems to lack organization. Not that the restaurant is dirty or disheveled, but the way it is set up doesn't make sense, considering the high volume of people it gets. The line literally wraps around the dining area, and makes it virtually impossible for people to get inside the area where the tables are to find seating. Also, the restaurant is divided into sections. A salad area, a place to order your sandwiches, hot dogs, etc, and then a dessert area. Why can't you just order all at once without having to navigate through crowds of people?

3. The food is just okay. In our party, we ordered the Italian beef sandwich with roasted peppers and mozzarella, a hamburger, side of chicken tenders, cheese fries and regular fries. The sandwich was apparently decent. Not the best my boyfriend has had, but definitely not the worst. The hamburger was also good, but then again, they're not a hamburger joint, and how hard is it to mess up a hamburger. The chicken tenders were something like what you'd find at a Safeway deli. This doesn't mean that they were bad-- they were just average. Not to mention, one of the chicken tenders in the box (each box is a 4-piece) was about the size of a McDonald's chicken nugget, if not smaller. The one thing that caught me was the two orders of fries.. With the cheese fries, you get a normal order of fries with a cup of fake nacho cheese-esque sauce, that you're supposed to dip your fries in or whatever. I would have definitely preferred a cheese that was either melted on top or that had a bit more flavor. And the fries themselves, by looks and taste, were somewhat like the crinkle-cut fries that you'd find in the frozen food section of your local grocer. 

Regardless, they still have a really cute atmosphere/decor: that of a 50's/60's Chicago-style diner, and their staff seems to know most of what they're doing. I would go back because their prices are great ($3.65 for a decent-sized burger), but it would be under the conditions that 1. the weather is nice because it's a 50/50 chance that you'll be sitting outside, and 2. that I have a solid hour, hour and a half to blow considering the line to order and the wait to get your food and then find a table. 

Anyhow, to sum it up: not great, not terrible. Just average., nan",Leanna,135,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

Wow it is still pretty busy with lots of families everywhere enjoying themselves and having a tasty treat at the same time. I even saw several groups giving each other hugs with excitement as they gathered up together.

Both inside and out are very clean and well decorated with style. It is fun just going around and looking at all the cool items hanging on the wall. This place is oiled like a well tuned machine. Simply walk up and order, pay, then step to the side and pick up your food. You can watch them diligently working in the kitchen to get the orders to perfection. Cool!

Had to get a Jumbo Dog Chicago Style which is basically what they call everything. Also tried out the Beef and Cheddar on a Croissant with Sweet Peppers. The wife ordered an Italian Beef with Sweet Peppers and a large side of Cheese Fries to share.

The food was really tasty and fresh. I particularly liked the Dog which was created perfectly and had a great flavor profile. The Beef and Cheddar was also very tasty but seemed to be a little skimpy on the beef. The basic Fries and Cheese was hypnotically good. Maybe I'm just a sucker for that kinda cheesy goodness. They also have Burgers, Chicken Sandwiches, Salads, plus a whole lot more.

Nice place and I would definitely go back again. Would like to see the foot traffic for the order line go around the outside of the dinning area instead of cutting right through the middle and creating a criss cross of confusion for those eating, trying to get a napkin, or a refill. Maybe hiring a Feng shui Master to give it an adjustment. Reversing the kitchen would be too expensive at this point. LOL!

You gotta get the beef dipped with sweet peppers.  Some go for cheese, but honestly I think that just takes away from the amazingness of the beef itself.  I guess I'm pretty simple. 

A helpful tip to avoid the crazy crowd:  go right when they open!  That's what we did and it was easy breezy and quiet.

Today we visited Portillo's and are so happy we did.  We had their Italian Beef sandwich and it was like being back in Chicago. We LOVED it. My husband liked it so much he ordered the Big Beef sandwich to go and had it later this evening at home.  One of their salads made my mouth water so next time I'm going to try that. It's an apple walnut chicken salad. The place is large, airy, a little on the noisy side, quick service, plenty of space and an outside patio.

I had no idea what to expect other than knowing they took over the old spot that Uncle Sam's used to fill on 91st and Shea. 

First off, I COULD NOT BELIEVE how busy it was, especially for a weekday lunch in an area without a large concentration of businesses (I work downtown). Drive through line was a mile long (but seemed to be moving quickly). When we got inside I was shocked at the amount of people cramed into this large space. Not a table to be found and long lines again, but we had made the drive so there was no turning back... Glad we didn't because that line moved quickly also.

My buddy and I both got the ""combo"" sandwich, which is an Italian Beef with a sausage stuck in there also. Strangly enough my Chicago friend got a chicken sandwich, which apparently he loves there.

Cool thing about the ""combo"", or just regular beef sandwiches, is you can choose how much ""gravy"" you want on them. Hardly any, some poured on top, or, and of course the one that I picked, DIPPED. They dip the who damn sandwich in the ""gravy"" (beef drippings). NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN BOUT.

We got cheese fries too. Fries were good but they put the cheese on the side...kind of a bummer, BUT the sandwiches were excellent... Best Italian Beef I've had other than Luke's of Chicago on Indian School, which is quite a compliment.

We did end up finding seats by the way. Very crowded place, but a lot of turnover, so if you just wait a second something will pop up.

Prices were excellent also. Most sandwiches were right around $5 bucks, even the Halibut fish sandwich, which I gotta try next...I'll be back. Gotta try the dogs too!!

We had never been to a Portillo's previously and wanted to try it.  We contemplated parking and going in or using the drive-thru. We saw several employees standing outside with headsets and such; we were concerned something was wrong with the telecom system that most drive-thru places use. We decided to chance it and use the drive-thru. 

When we pulled up, a friendly employee greeted us and asked to take our order. We explained that this was our first time, so she handed us two menus. I decided to get the chili cheese dog and my husband decided on the Maxwell Street Style Polish dog. We both decided on onion rings. The employee told us to drive around and pay at the second window. Again, there were several employees outside waiting to take our money and hand us our food. They were all very friendly so I asked why they were standing outside. Apparently this is what they do! All day, every day - unless it's really busy and not efficient to do so. Call me crazy, but this was totally bizarre to me. It was a very hot day, but AZ can get scorching during the summer. Let's hope they are inside on those days! 

Our food was prepared quickly and we took it home to enjoy. My chili cheese dog was really good - everything was flavorful and the bun was soft.

Okay, that lead line sounds horrible, but it's accurate. My wife and I loved Portillo's when we lived in Chicago. Cheap, good eats and an authentic Chicago Dog.  My father-in-law spent decades loving the Italian Beef sandwiches.  Prices are very good for the amount of food.

Truth is there is a lot of hype associated with Portillo's coming to the Phoenix area from folks with Chicago roots.  It's a classic and old-time fave.  Food is yummy and authentic, but nothing remarkable compared to your places with innovative chefs.  Um, it's also not considered health food.  (Just FYI. :o))

So, PORTILLO'S has been open since TUESDAY (4 days ago) and it is MOBBED!  And for good reason.

Like everyone elses reviews.... it was the BOMB!

The beef was totally and competely DELISHHHHHHH!

Perfectly ""wet"" and and ample amount of beef and the sweet and hot peppers gave it that extra burst of flavor.

The hubby had a chili cheese dog which he enjoyed, but come on now....why do we really go to Portillo's?

It's for the beef and DEBRA'S wonderful, creamy, rich Chocolate Cake!

OMG.... The hubby thought I was crazy for talking so much about how great this cake was and after taking one bite of mine.... he quickly took possession and all that was left for me was the last bite....which was just as good as the first bite and even better than I remember it to be.

The lines were massive and I commend the entire staff for moving everything along quickly and efficently.

It was well worth the wait and I cant wait for the Tempe location to open.

I've been super interested to try it, but wanted to wait until the initial craziness was past. 

We finally checked it out this past weekend and wow! So yummy. 

Parking was crowded, but we found a spot easily enough. There is a nice patio at the front with plenty of seating and tables overshadowed by umbrellas. The restaurant is kitschy, with memorabilia covering the walls and hanging from the ceiling - Flash Gordon poster, bicycle, airplane pedal car... 

The dining room is very clean and teeming with staff - we were greeted at arrival, handed paper menus, and ushered into one of two lines stretching up to the counter. We reviewed the menus and when we reached the front of the line, were directed to one of the windows to order. This whole process was a bit frenzied - we didn't really have an ample amount of time to decide on our orders before we hit the front of the line, and when we did, getting up to a window while not cutting off someone from the other line was somewhat stressful. One of our only snags during the dining experience came when we got to the counter and learned that the printed menus that we had been looking over to make our choices were NOT actually current menus. So we had to make some rapid re-selections on-the-fly. 

Your order is assigned a number and you have to listen for it to be announced, then go pick it up from the window. The girls announcing that the orders are ready have funny catch phrases for each number: ""Fifty Four, wait no more!"" etc, which is entertaining the first 5 times you hear them (but I'll come back to this) 

You pick up your orders on large trays with drink holders in each corner and reminderd me of the trays that used to clip to your car window at A&W Rootbeer stands (if anyone remembers those) They're handy for transporting your food to the table, but are very bulky and get in the way if your table is crowded, like ours was.

We ordered The Italian Beef with spicy peppers and mozzarella, a Grilled Chicken Sandwich, a Hamburger, and a few orders of crinkle french fries. 

The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was pretty okay - more ""meh"" than amazing. 

The Hamburger was good - flattened thinner, similar to other midwestern imports (Freddie's, for example) which meant that the flavor was more concentrated and it was crispier than your standard burger. The bread got very soggy and the toppings were in disarray, so it was a mess to eat. 

The crinkle fries were okay - we got three orders for the 3.5 of us and I'd probably tailor that down to 2 orders (or maybe even 1) the next time. They came out CRAZY hot, too hot to eat, so we had to wait a bit before digging in. They tasted alright and had good texture, but weren't anything to write home about.

The Italian Beef was, as others say, incredibly good. The beef was sliced very thinly and then piled on thick.  It was savory, juicy, and very flavorful. The bread was pretty thin and did get terribly soggy from the juices of the sandwich. I ordered it with spicy peppers and mozzarella; the mozzarella was barely there, but I was so glad that I ordered the peppers! The juice from the peppers permeated the whole sandwich, giving an extra dimension to the flavors - the peppers themselves were not overwhelmingly spicy, which was nice. There were some little crinkly pickled carrots in the mix as well, which was weird at first but tasted fine. Eating the sandwich is tricky: it comes in two wrappers, a larger outer wrapper that is more ""dry"" and a more tightly wrapped inner wrapper. I took my sandwich out of the outer wrapper but kept the inner wrapper on so that it would blockade the sogginess and keep the sandwich together. This was a good move; my friend who also got the Italian Beef did NOT do this, and it was a huge mess. 

The dining room is very hectic. The seating is bordered by the line of guests, the order counter, the pickup window, and the catering counter. The cacophony of the many guests plus the announcer calling out the orders is definitely less than relaxing.  Hearing ""54 wait no more"" 100 times while you dine is not so great. However, the decor, very friendly and attentive employees, cleanliness of the restaurant, and overall casual level of the place all make for a very fun experience that was ultimately quite enjoyable. 

Pricing was okay - just over $30 for three adults and one baby, so not too bad. 

The staff were phenomenal. My expectations are generally pretty low in a place that has really young employees, but you can tell that the training at Portillos is top-notch and that they ask a lot of their team. We were greeted, treated politely and professionally, attended to (they have employees bussing the tables, collecting trash as you finish) and thanked as we left. 

I can definitely recommend Portillos for a delicious and lovely casual lunch or dinner. Be sure to check it out!, nan",Jessica,93,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

Usually with bottled water you pay twice that for only 'purified drinking water' so definitely nice they had the real deal.

My food was delivered hot and fresh but simply lacked flavor. I found no condiment other than ketchup and even that wasn't available in to go form. The hot dog was all beef and had the snap of natural casing, but the chili was bland and featured beans (an abomination to any old-fashioned traditionalist-minded Texan).  It just needed SOMETHING, even salt & black pepper would have helped.  The fries were hot and a little salty but the cheese sauce was like what you get on bad ballpark nachos.

The hot dogs are probably the best item I've tried, had the chili cheese dog - cheese is a little pasty so I would have it without next time but I enjoyed it otherwise. The regular hot dog is good, they put a ton of toppings on it and it has good flavor.  The burgers are just ok, I like the char broiled flavor but the meat was a little rubbery.  Italian beef was soggy and had a flavor I didn't care for, I think the was the gravy, it had an off/almost artificial beef flavor.  Their onion rings are very good and I love the crinkle cut fries.

I would like to try the tamale in a bowl and their sausage sandwich so I'll be heading back but you can get better burgers/dogs at other places (AJ's supermarket is actually better).

Well, cheap owner of Portillo's, can you put in a self-serve beverage refill counter? I do not want to have to go awkwardly across the pick up line to get another beverage. This is Arizona. We expect free refills with 105 degree weather.

Yes. I will return to Portillo's because it is good and well priced. I will pay extra for a couple of extra inches on a sandwich. In fact, I am back at the office now and still hungry. Maybe I will return for that delicious Italian Beef.

I've had the burgers, hot dogs, and Italian beef and all are four-star or better...but I'm here to tell you about the Italian beef, which is the best I've ever had.  

I'm not inclined towards Italian beef and while I always try the Italian beef (I'm from Chicago and in a never-ending search for the best Italian beef), I typically opt for a meatball or chicken parm sub when eating at Rosati's or other restaurants that offer Italian beef because few live up to Portillo's.  With that said - WOW!  An Italian beef, dipped with sweet peppers and hot giardiniera on the side is HEAVENLY.  Don't forget dipped - it's a must as many of these reviews agree!  The meat gravy/juice boasts oregano and black pepper and isn't over-salted.  It turns a four-star sandwich into a ten star sandwich!  Many in my family opt for the beef and cheddar croissant and ask for a side of the meat juice, which I'll go for occasionally too.  They won't dip these because the croissant falls apart but you can juice it up on your own and deal with the messy deliciousness.  My dad opts for the Italian combo, dipped, which is Italian beef and Italian sausage.  I've never had it but his refusal to share even a bite tells me something!

The fries are crinkle cut food service fries but of the high-end variety and cooked to crispy perfection.  When served with their sharp cheese sauce, they compliment the main dish nicely.

I also need to mention the cake shake.  It is what it says it is - an entire piece of chocolate cake blended into a chocolate shake.  Unique and delicious.

There is a reason why there always a line of cars around this place.  4.5 stars is the correct rating based on food service fries and onion rings instead of making them fresh but the overall quality of the main dishes has me rounding up., nan",Marc,3,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

They were great over the phone answering questions and being patient...I had a lot. They sent email confirmation and were all around awesome. The day to pick up arrived and they had everything ready to go...no waiting around.

That's when I realized I locked my keys in the car with my cell phone...awesome.

Finally we got me a cab and I got the food back to the office. It was great. We had the beef and some Italian sausages with their bread, which was great too. We got some toppings for both like hot peppers and such.

The shakes taste worse than fast food syrup concoctions sitting out overnight and the hot dog is sub-par at best.

1st the food - had Italian beef, chili dogs, cheese fries and onion rings,  Food was good, portions a bit on the small side.  The large fries were not that large (ok maybe I am getting spoiled by Five Guys).  Thought the Italian beef could have used something else, I did get the peppers added, but they should also include grilled onions.

BUT, they FORGOT the gravy on the side  for the Italian beef.  And this after I ordered it, and even read back the order when we picked it up, and confirmed that they included with the order.  And when we got home, NO gravy (I think they got confused, as we ordered cheesy fries, and probably thought that was the gravy).  How can you have an Italian beef without the gravy.

It's a little chaotic and always full, but it's a great experience. I've tried quite a few of the items and been here multiple times, so here are my reviews for them.
Chili cheese hotdog: Great! Chock full of cheese, chili, and onions. The hotdogs are great quality and the buns are soft, and delicious. Make sure to get the jumbo size! Definitley a lot bigger, but not too much more expensive.

Regular Hotdog: Just okay. I guess I'm not fans of any chicago dogs, but on the bright side, the thing was very full!

Italian Beef: MMMM!! What can I even say? The first bite was a little weird, but as I kept eating, it got more and more amazing!! The beef is perfectly cooked, and almost buttery tasting, and has a little kick of heat. THe flavor is seriously amazing, and bread compliments it perfectly. And for those who complain it's soggy, it's dipped in the juices! If you don't like it, ask for it ""Dry"" 

Cheese Fries: The fries are quite generic, but they're cooked perfectly crispy, and the inside is very soft. The cheese, as always, is great.

Burgers: They're pretty great. But why would you order a burger at Portillos? Good, but not recommended unless you're not a fan of anything else here.

Chopped Salad: Pretty good. But still, not worth it.  It has a very unique flavor and a nice sweet tang. Probably not worth getting again.

Chocolate cake shake: Just okay, great for chocolate lovers, but too sweet in my taste.

Overall, if you're a hotdog fan and looking for a great hotdog in the valley, this is defintley recommended. I also recommend the italian beef.

Perhaps Portillo's changed since branching out or perhaps my memory distorts the truth. Going to Portillo's in Scottsdale was like watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as an adult--I don't know what I ever saw in this.

To begin, I visited twice: once during peak hours and once in between the lunch and dinner rush. During peak hours, the wait was long, I was scolded for taking a picture inside, the order was incorrect, and the burgers were similar in quality to Wendy's. The second visit wasn't much better. I entered the drive through to see more attendants than cars and waited 15 minutes for a cheeseburger with only one car ahead of me. Upon arriving home, the fries were only half full, the soda was mostly ice, and the burger was a soggy mess of mayo and ketchup. I took three bites of the burger and tossed it in the trash.

Here I am going to ""go against the grain"" with a mediocre Review of a New Restaurant receiving mostly good Reviews.

Okay, so maybe I am a ""Hot Dog Snob"" from the East Coast, where everyone knows there is only one brand of Hot Dog that can stand up to being boiled instead of grilled. (The ""Dirty Water Dog"" is the Sabrett brand, in Natural Casing).

In fairness to this new location and because I love Hot Dogs I tried three varieties:

                        With everything! (The Chicago way)

                        With Mustard and Relish only (My favorite)
 
                        Chile Cheese Dog

Let me say, the ""Toppings"" are terrific. The problem is with the Hot Dog itself. Far too mild, no beefy taste (Bordering on no taste), overwhelmed by the toppings and with very little ""snap"" when biting into it.

Probably in the minority, but just NOT as good as the size of the Restaurant and the reputation would indicate.

Ted's is still the ""Hot Dog Of Choice"" in Phoenix and they are from Buffalo, New York. 

Willing to venture to Maricopa for the BEST BOILED HOT DOGS EVER (Sabrett)? If so, go to Al's Dogs located next to O'Reilly Auto Parts on John Wayne in Maricopa.

There are several better hot dogs in the valley.  See Ted's for a similar priced dog that will blow your mind, or The Main Ingredient Ale House for a top notch ""fancy"" dog.

The beef sandwich is fine, but it's not something to bring me back.  It's kind of fun having a sogged sandwich disintegrate in your mouth like bread thrown to ducks.  But it's also kind of like eating duck-grade bread.  The gravy/jus is flavorful but the meat isn't anything special.  Tender and well prepared but not much to it.

Love their Italian Beef sandwiches.  I usually do mine dry (very little gravy) with cheese, hot peppers and onions. I also order a side a gravy to dip my sandwich in. Wish they included these extras in the price of the sandwich but they all are an extra cost. You can't go wrong with their cheese fries. They are a crinkle cut and one of my faves.  Their cheeseburgers are actually really good and my kids love their Chocolate Cake Shake.

If I'm feeling like I need to cut back on the meat and bread, I order a salad instead. My two favorites are the Poppyseed Fruit w/ Chicken Salad and the Chopped Salad. The salads come with a lemon poppyseed muffin and are very tasty.

I don't even like hot dogs but the throngs of people flowing through the doors at noon piqued our curiosity. After some initial disorientation due to the over abundance of signage, we located a paper menu and were pleasantly surprised that most of the menu items were not hotdogs. 

I ordered a broiled chicken sandwich and my husband  chose the Italian roast beef sandwich.  My sandwich was fabulous! The bun was super fresh and there was a moist real chicken breast with some lettuce and tomato on it. The Italian sandwich was loaded with meat which had been soaked in a flavourful au jus. The $5 prices seemed like a bargain for them. 

The sides of fries and onion rings  were nothing special but the apple walnut chicken salad and the chocolate malt are on my list for our next visit.

It wasn't incredibly busy like I had seen passing by other times, so maybe the 7 staff members standing outside to take orders usually have more to do, but it seemed way overstaffed at that point.

Visited yesterday on a recommendation from one of their staff members I met who seemed to have nothing but wonderful things to say about his employer's restaurant. Needless to say his opinion failed to meet my expectations. 

First impressions are not everything. Make no mistake, the building itself is impeccably decorated. Inside and out are both done up really well. The place was absolutely jam packed with people too. At least 150 people were crammed into the premises, all seemingly enjoying the rush of the fast paced ordering service. And it's here that I have to hand it to them. With lines nearly out the door (and it's a long way from the registers to the exit), employees handled the crowd with ease. No hiccups. No rudeness. Perfect service. At this point it's safe to say I was impressed and excited to eat!
 
Unfortunately you just cannot rely on first impressions. The decor is a facade for what really is going on here. Only one word comes to mind when I now think of Portillo's: GIMMICK. The food here is nothing to write home about at all, or maybe it is, just not in the way you might think. The hot dogs I ordered were served in your typical Chicago style. Sesame seed bun, pickle, hot peppers, tomatoes, onions, and mustard. How could you go wrong? Right? Well they managed to... The bun was straight out of a cheap grocery brand bag. The hotdog tasted like an undercooked Bar S hotdog glazed with the dirty dollar bills Dick Portillo managed to swindle out of me. I could have easily made this at home for a fraction of the price and effort. Even the onion rings were from a low grade frozen grocery store brand. I know this because I often buy the exact same ones to eat at home, they are indistinguishable in both looks and taste. Terribly mediocre and good only for a quick frozen home meal. 

Some people will gawk at my review and say ""Try the Italian beef. You'll change your mind."" And to that I say ""My friend ordered the 'Italian' beef and cheese croissant with gravy. I took one bite and found myself only pushed further to disgust by this rip off of an establishment."" 

What a waste of time and money. I think it's safe to say Portillo's failed to gain a regular customer yesterday. I also think it's safe to say I won't be recommending this pace to anyone any time soon. 

The only thing saving it from receiving a one star review is it's visual appeal and perfectly managed staff. So... kudos to you Dick Portillo for creating one of the largest privately owned food brands around! What a business plan you've crafted here too! Incredibly cheap ingredients and components sold at a premium... Wow... Can you say profits?! I'd love to own the place for a week. A privately owned chain with an owner who's story defines the ""American Dream"" and basing out of a city famous for this style of food...

I never bothered to read reviews or visit the website and thought it was just a big hot dog joint. How excited can anyone ever get about a hot dog?

After reading some great reviews here, my wife and I made an early lunch run Sunday to try the Italian Beef sandwiches and were both very glad we did. She got hers with the spicy peppers and I went with the sweet peppers ($0.50 extra) and neither option disappointed! The peppers came with just the right amount of juice to soak the meat and roll.

The fries were crinkle cut, crispy and just the right amount of salt. The big plus was for an extra $0.50, you get a side of liquid cheese to dip them in if you're into that.  Onion rings were great too! 

There were a lot of other things on the menu I wanted to try but didn't have the room for, so we will definitely add Portillo's to our list of favorite places to eat at since its right down the street.

This place is super cute! I love the way it's set up, very open, fits a ton of people, cute little patio out front, they have a convenient drive through and have a great mix of old school/Chicago decor, set up in a modern way (if that makes any sense)

The menu is larger then I thought it would be there are salads, hamburgers, chicken sandwiches and of course hot dogs!! I decided to go with the Jumbo Chili Dog, Cheese fries and a drink! Wish I had room for dessert, or a chocolate shake! Definitely going to order that next time! A lot of places over cook hot dogs, or have awful tasting chili they pile on top. It's nice to actually get a perfectly cooked/juicy hot dog, on a delicious seasoned bun, with flavorful chili! Ohhh and the fries! I LOVE crinkle fries.... a lot of places stopped serving them! Portillos hit home with me with the crinkle fires! Nice and crispy, crunchy, the way crinkle fries should taste!

Overall great experience! This place is very laid back, casual, family and date friendly! The staff is very courteous and welcoming! Worth the lines and the kayos! I recommend going later at night around 9pm is when we went (I know that is late to eat) but there were no lines, received our food in about 5 minutes, sat and enjoyed each others company while people watching and took the long drive home!

Best hot dog you'll ever have, and it's only $3 for a jumbo. it's only the best if you get everything on it. If you're a plain hot dog eater, go to Costco.

Originally they had people from Chicago training the Scottsdale team on how to act like they are from Chicago. Unfortunately, they are (or at least, seem to be) all gone now, so you're left with teenagers trying to pretend like their from Chicago. It's both endearing and awkward.

If you go to get the hotdog, spend the little extra to get the Premium/Jumbo dog. Its the same bun and fixings, but the meat quality is like the difference between Nathan's and a highschool cafetera. In my opinion they should stop offering the standard quality hot dog and just go all out on the jumbos.

Upon opening my Italian beef sandwich I found a long hair tangled in the wrapper touching the bread of the sandwich,  not sure if it could have been mine (giving them the benefit of doubt)  I examined it.  Absolutely not my hair...  I removed the hair and tried to eat around it and found another hair in my French fries!!  With all honesty this is what happened with absolutly no  exaggeration, these are facts.   I could not eat my food because I was SOOO disgusted! I told my boyfriend and he immediately went to an employee to explain the situation.  The first person he spoke to was understanding and said throw it in the trash and we will either make you new food or refund your money, new food just didn't sound good considering what just happened.  My boyfriend did as she said and threw the food in the trash.  he then went to the register to get refunded. The manager (peter) was there to speak with him and asked him where's the sandwich with the hair in it but my boyfriend did not have it because the portillos employee told him to throw it away along with the frys.  The manager Peter then with the most annoyed look on his face gave him two dollars and did not even apologize.   The sandwich and fries together equals almost 9 dollars, (we also had other food as well but felt like because the sandwich and fries both had HAIR in them we did not feel like we should pay for them) we just wanted to be refunded for the food that had the issues.  when my boyfriend asked for the rest of the money the manager Peter asked again for the sandwich and fries and became very argumentative and gave my boyfriend the most ignorant attitude about it, so my boyfriend offered to dig it out of the trash!  Peter the manager finally agreed to refund the rest of the money but began to talk very disrespectful and unprofessional!! This experience made us feel like we did something wrong when in fact it was them.  I will never eat at this establishment again and would recommend finding a real authentic Chicago restaurant!!

If you're eating at the restaurant, they'll fix the problem but certainly don't count on a good attitude about it, and don't expect an apology silly customer!

I am from Chicago and appreciated that they brought hometown favorites here to Scottsdale.

Tonight, we ordered one of the Chicago basics to go:  a big, Italian beef sandwich, wet, on a crispy roll with sweet peppers and extra a jus on the side

It came back on a burnt roll, dry, with 3 overcooked pepper slivers that looked like they were from yesterday's leftovers and  
a 1/2 full, tiny cup of a jus.

When I called the manager, Peter about the problem, he could not be any more rude, unhelpful and condescending and 
finally said we could expect a refund in 7-10 days, 
 
When, after 10 minutes waiting for and talking to him, I asked to talk with his boss, he said Jim had left for the day. 
No I'm sorry.  No how can we make this right.
No nothing.

My advice:  
Stay away from this used to be a good place and go to Spinato's or Vermont Sandwich Company for a great beef sandwich,

SERVICE: I'm not a huge fan of the cattle-call style of food service. The organization was pretty lax when I first arrived and we got 'cut' in line several times as groups came in. Eventually an employee came out and started sifting people into appropriate lines.

When it came time to get food, we were back to 'cattle-call' again. The woman calling out the orders was humorous at first; eventually her rhyming and overly-loud microphone just gave me a headache.

FOOD: I had an Italian beef sandwich. The beef was mostly flavorless and somewhat dry, even though I had ordered extra gravy; the cheese was rubbery, but at least it had some flavor from the grease on it. 

I tried a bite of a co-worker's hot dog; it wasn't anything special.

AMBIANCE: Can you hear me now? No? Then you might be at Portillo's. The only thing louder than the mishmash of decor is the actual noise level in the building. Don't bother trying to talk here. Including a pair of noise-canceling headphones with each order would be nice.

OVERALL: If you couldn't tell, I didn't really see any positives to the place. The food was mediocre, the style of service is annoying, and the noise level might just be tinnitus-inducing.

Now my dad loves Italian beef sandwiches, so i usually take him to Luke's across the freeway.  So sorry to Luke's for trying something new.  We got there about 11:30 am, just right before the lunch rush but looks like that started pretty early.  The outdoor patio was full with customers and the line inside was pretty long.  Now let me tell you that I've never seen so many people working in a restaurant before but it was definitely needed!  
The first thing you have to do is get in line to order your food.  Keep in mind that if you want salads, you would need to go to two different areas to pick up your food.  But like I said, there are lots or people working that its pretty quick for the order coming out.  Finding a table was no that big of a problem, so I had the Asian chicken salad and my dad had the Italian beef.  My mom and nephew had the Chicago style hot dogs.  The salad was very good and a good portion and i took a bite of the Italian beef and it was awesome.

So imagine my surprise while I was in Phoenix this past weekend to discover a brand new Portillo's right there in Scottsdale.

It's pretty much the same experience I have when in Chicago.  The staff was friendly and efficient which on my visit was definitely nice since the place was so busy.  Seriously, I realize it's new but I was surprised at the draw this place had.  In any case, the staff made the crowd much less of an ordeal than it could have been due to their organization.  So kudos to the management for good planning.

As to the food...well I of course had a hot dog and ordered it through the garden which is basically what we'd call a Chicago dog outside of Chicago.  Hot dog and veggies!  It's healthier that way right?  My friend and I also split an Italian beef sandwich which we ordered hot and dipped.  If you've never had this culinary delight, it's like a roast beef sandwich with some hot peppers and then the whole thing is soaked in the juice from the meat.  You may have to use a fork to eat it but your taste buds won't care!  It was all very tasty. 

My friend who lives in Phoenix was sold and planned to go back again.  If i lived there, I'm certain I would be darkening Portillo's doors often too.  It's good food.   Really.  Go and enjoy!, nan",Steve,70,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

Once I read the description on the menu, I knew I had to try it.  It promised me freshly grilled veggies,  mushrooms and Havarti cheese on grilled foccacia.  The promise of yum.  Unfortunately, the sandwich didn't really deliver.  The positives:  it was large (enough for two meals) and served piping hot.  Unfortunately, I couldn't distinguish the flavor of any of the vegetables.  Everything just combined and it wasn't very tasty.  I think the mushrooms were overpowering.  Again, I get it.

The employees are very ""Chicago"", filled with personality and attitude, all working for a seemingly competent and well managed organization to boot.  The interior was very clean, it appeared that they have numerous employees who's function it  is to quickly clean up tables as guests pick up their trays to depart.  Many other restaurants come to mind that should take note.

On to the food:  the Hot Dog was, well a Hot Dog.  Delicious in it's own right, but a Hot Dog nonetheless.  One discerning characteristic comes to mind, the poppy seed bun.  Fresh, almost spongy, not soggy.

Italian Beef was the best of recent memory, possibly knocking Mr.Beef (666 N Orleans St, Chicago IL) off of my #1 spot.  Ordered it wet with hot peppers.  Serving was proper, plenty of meat, bread that was moist and retained much of the Au Jus.  Purely Fantastic!  Onion Rings were delicious, not too thick,  the batter is unique in its texture, much crispier than I remember rings typically being.

They did an amazing job to make sure things ran efficient and people got their food.  It was a bright move for the Management to not let people reserve seats until they got their food.  By doing so, it allowed everyone to have a chance to find an open seat and enjoy their meal.  

The turnout for this Grand Opening was unreal.  The line was long and continued to grow throughout the night.  I got in line at around 5pm with maybe 100+ people in front of me.  My wife joined me in line 15 minutes later and I only moved maybe 20 ft.  It took about 1 hour 30 min to get our food but we had no complaints.  The line moved fairly quickly for the amount of people that were there.  There was a good control of the line, didn't notice anyone cutting or anything.  

Now onto the reason why we went there.  Since it was our first time at Portillo's, the wife and I decided to try out a few things.  We got the Hot Dog with everything on it, the Jumbo Chili Cheese Dog, Italian Beef with sweet peppers and mozarella cheese, large fries, and a Large Chocolate Cake Shake.  Everything was delicious!!  Between the two hot dogs, I enjoyed the regular hot dog with everything on it instead.  The Italian beef was amazing. I will ask for gravy on the side the next time I go so I can dip my sandwich in it.  The chocolate cake shake was like heaven in your mouth.  It was that good.  I think getting a large of that is just too much sweets for even two people.  I would get a smaller size the next time.

It was a great experience to be there on the Grand Opening day.  We will definitely be going back on our cheat days!, nan",Joe,44,"['Burgers', 'Hot Dogs', 'Salad', 'Restaurants']",Portillo's Hot Dogs,"10574 N 90th Street

The dinner however left a bit to be desired.  I mean, they used tortilla chips from Safeway, and couldn't substitute their pinto beans for black beans.  What kind of Latin restaurant is this??

We went here around 6 pm after going to Fez for their happy hour and having a margarita and an appetizer. We sat at the bar and were definitely happy with the ambience and service - the bartenders were all very attentive, refilling our water frequently and making sure we had everything we needed. 

We were still pretty hungry by the time we arrived at Ticoz from Fez, and their food definitely did not disappoint in terms of portion size! We weren't as in love with the flavors of the food, though. We got three things: the half-size Grilled Peach Salad, ($6.50), Pork Torta Sandwich ($9.75), and Crispy Calamari ($9.95). The salad was definitely fresh and had a flavorful dressing, but we were super-disappointed to discover that the peach slices (of which there were only three) were canned. Yes, they had grill marks, but grilling can't really bring out the flavor and tenderness of syrupy, almost mushy canned peaches. Disappointing. The Crispy Calamari was not too chewy, but the batter it was fried in was pretty flavorless and the lime dipping sauce could have had more kick to it. 

The biggest standout was definitely the Pork Torta Sandwich - the meat was really tender and flavorful (although a bit over-seasoned) and the slaw that came with it was delicious. The other highlight was my Blood Orange Margarita, which wasn't overly sweet and definitely complemented the spiciness of the pork sandwich.

So, I guess you really need to like watermelon if you plan on ordering that.  I preferred the passion fruit made with red wine.  

For dinner I ordered a big ol' burrito covered in cheese and my friend got the tacos.  Everything was great and let me tell you, that burrito was the biggest thing I've ever seen.  Bring a hearty appetite.  

The server was super friendly and talked me through all his favorites since I couldn't make up my mind.

The portions are good sized and they bring you chips (not even the best store bought) and salsa. The salsa has three varieties. When they first opened they had the best salsa in town with huge stewed tomato chunks. Now it is good, but... We like to get different things and share them here. One of the things that we often get is the tamale. We like it even meatless. I have had much better food, but they have a good mix of food, ambiance and service. I don't get here as often as I would like, but it is a regular haunt., nan",Bill,126,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

I have to admit, I was a skeptic after the first time I went here. The Sangria was great but I was not a fan of the food. Considering that the drinks had been so good, I decided to give it another shot, and I am glad that I did. My second visit even got Ticoz an extra star from me.

First visit:

I came here during happy hour on a weekday night because I had been really interested in checking it out. The first thing I did was order a Passion Fruit Sangria. It was amazing by the way and tasted very homemade! I then decided to get some food. There was a lot on the menu that caught my eye, but I decided to play it safe with a burrito. The waitress then recommended the tilapia, which sounded like a winner. It's then that I noticed the toppings for the burritos; there was enchilada style and queso style. Thinking that some melted cheese on my burrito would take the taste over the top, I ordered it that way. -- Let me just say really quickly that the waitress was pretty fantastic, though she sounded a bit scripted. That's understandable though considering the place started packing in a crowd. -- Now, back to the food. I was completely baffled when I saw my burrito. It was completely covered in cheese. Normally this would have been great, but in this case it was covered in what looked to be movie theater nacho cheese. Ticoz is a swanky place so I brushed it off and gave it a taste. No joke, it tasted like movie theater nacho cheese. I had no idea what I had done to my food! When I think of ""queso style"" I think of shredded cheese melted over the burrito via a broiler or something. The contents of the burrito were delicious, but the topping soiled their flavor (I even tried to scrape it off). I left Ticoz that night wishing that I had ordered something else to eat.

This leads us to visit number two...

Second visit:

This time I decided to go for breakfast and I am pleased to say that I had a great time. Two dollars mimosas and pork chile verde in the morning hit the spot! To condense this visit to a sentence: The drinks were just as good as before and the food was great!

I can now say that I like Ticoz and I am happy to be able to say so. My one request is for them to lay off the cheese sauce for their burrito. Now go check out their happy hour!, nan",Nader,205,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

My last experience at Ticoz was awful... It seems like as soon as Lola Tapas closed, everything went completely downhill. The happy hour went way up (used to be $2 sangria on Tuesdays now $3.50), they hired a new staff, service became crap during busy hours, they altered their menu (to cheapen it up) - like Kat S said, there used to be 3 salsas that came with freshly fried chips...now, there is one crappy salsa that, last time I visited, came with cold, stale chips - and to top things off, their sangrias lack the greatness in flavor and quality that I once saw in them.

It really sucks to regularly go somewhere and watch it crumble. Ticoz initially ticked me off, but then won me over for the longest time. I recommended people go there and have a great experience (and sangria), but like any roller coaster relationship, the highs and lows are beginning to take their toll on me, and I know I need to just let go. I may wind up at Ticoz if a friend of mine wants to go, but I won't be leading the pack there anytime soon. #sadface, nan",Nader,205,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

As for food, she ordered a 1/2 salad which was pretty big. It was the chop salad and there were a ton of fresh ingredients involved, including hominy! They had some 1/2 price apps also, but I opted for two tacos for $5 with shredded chicken. The tacos were good and the chipotle creama was the difference in making these things stand out.

Every meal should be a good meal, right? So when some friends of ours asked us to meet them for dinner, well, we went. 

Made a reservation after hearing about the wait times.. when we arrived we were sat immediately. Let me say that the space is very cool.. Ikea like, in fact we have the same floor lamp in our living room, 39.99 if interested. For whatever reason I thought that Ticoz was more upscale in their service though I was disappointed when we were told we needed to hang on to our silverware, yuck!! So be prepared to ask for new silverware! 

The salsa's were a nice touch though they need to get rid of that pineapple crap.. oh and the chips, well those are Tostito's or something.. not a good impression at all. I'm not sure if they know this but Food City actually makes some really good chips they could just buy rather then use those stale disks from????

Got a mojito.. very good, one of the best Ive had in the valley! Ordered apps.. guacummus (sp) and calamari.. the guacamole hummus mixture was alright.. wouldn't order that again though the pita tasty.. the calamari was definitely from a frozen bag.. though for these prices they will have to cut where they can.

Doh, avoid the grilled peach salad.. tasted weird.. the blue cheese salad on the other hand.. yummy! Ive never seen so much blue cheese on a salad plate before.. kudos! We did ask for fresh cracked pepper, our server put a shaker of pepper on the table.. its little touches like these that can make or break a place.. guess that kind of service is overlooked here. 

I have to say though that the burgers were awesome! Both juicy, well cooked and delish! Criss cut fries were well seasoned and very tasty! The coleslaw that came on the side could have been omitted completely as it added nothing to the plate but bulk. Those burgers were fagalicious!

I liked it here, but not as much as the other two places.  First off, I LOVE the decor.  It's very cool and contemporary, but it has a warm Spanish flair that really suits the place.  The bar area is really cool, like the place where all the cool kids would hang out.  You would never expect any of this just by looking at the outside of the building.

For food, I ordered the Latin Passion salad which was a tasty mix of field greens and baby spinach topped with pinto beans, jack cheese, corn, tortilla strips, and mixed with a sweet and spicy tropical dressing.  You also get tomatoes and cilantro, but I opted out, yuck!  The salad was really big, and I only ordered the half size!  I definitely couldn't finish it.  The greens were all very fresh and all the toppings added lots of great textures and subtle flavors.  The dressing was really great.  I usually don't like spicy stuff, but I really enjoyed this dressing.  It was really light but the spice gave it a full flavor.

I also tasted some of the french fries and passion slaw that my Mom In Law had.  The slaw was really yummy and very different from the slaw you would expect.  The fries were okay, not really my favorite.  We also had a trio of salsas served to us before our meal and I tried two of them.  Again, I don't like tomatoes, so this is a bit uncommon.  One of the salsas was a pineapple salsa and it was delicious.  The sweet tangy flavor of the pineapple was perfect with the super salty tortilla chips.  I also tried the very spicy salsa that didn't have chunks of anything in it and it was also very good... in very small doses.

Overall, I liked Ticoz, but it isn't really my favorite kind of food.  I'm just too picky.  I will probably be back and hopefully I can expand my culinary horizons just a bit., nan",Bri,483,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

We finally completed the trinity by getting to Ticoz over the labor day weekend.  They were having some amazing deals on sangria and we wanted to meet up with friends after First Fridays so it seemed like the perfect chance.

The decor is amazing.  Love the lounge area around the bar, especially the couches.  We sat over in the bar and met up with our friends.  I don't know how long they had been there but they didn't have their drinks yet when we arrived and the waiter didn't exactly rush to come over and take our order.  When he did, he was gone for what seemed like forever getting our drinks.  They came out eventually and they were great.

Then we all ordered some food and I personally got the guacummus or whatever it is.  I'd been dying to try it and totally glad I did.  It was an amazing combo and the pita bread and black corn tortilla chips really made it a great late night meal.  We ordered some more drinks and enjoyed our food.  Everyone seemed to be really happy with their food.

So later in the night, a large section of our group decided they were going to head back to Scottsdale so they asked for their bill.  It took our waiter a while to get their bills and then to pick them back up.  Our friends were a bit annoyed because they really wanted to get out of there before it got too late.  Once they had left, the waiter barely paid any attention to us.  

The funny thing about it is that all of our friends who left were gay and those of us who stayed, are straight.  This fits in with my theory from Fez where only gays get attentive service.  

We practically had to yell at our waiter to get any more drinks by that point in the evening and then, without asking if we were done, he just brought us our bills.  I guess he was ready for us to leave.  In all, it was sort of a mixed experience.  As with Switch and Fez, the service can be terrible on a busy night but great on a normal night.

I was totally prepared to wait when we arrived because we got there at about 7:15 on a Friday night.  They said 30 min wait for a party of 5. Not too bad.  After watching 3 groups who came in after us be seated first (and yes, one was a party of 5) we approached the hostess stand to check on things.  Suddenly we were ""next"".

Server was Justin.  He said his hellos, told us about the specials, took our drink orders. We'd planned to try a few appetizers, but at that point we were all hungry enough we wanted to go right for the main course. Then we were brought the chips and salsa.  I inquired about the 3 salsas.  He said, this one is hot, this one is pico de gallo, and this is our pineapple salsa.  The chips weren't just ""got out of a bag"" chips, they were no-name, not very good, wouldn't serve them to my friends chips.  But, we nibbled on them anyhow because we wanted to try the salsas.  I went right for the hot.  Hot?  It was barely warm.  It was very ""tomato"" tasting, with one person commenting that it almost had spagetti sauce taste.  How can you be going for a Latin flavor and not be packing any heat??  I try the ""Pico de gallo"".  It's chunky salsa.  But whatever.  It had that fresh taste that many salsas have fresh out of the bottle.  My last hopes were the pineapple salsa.  It was different, and in the end the one I actually liked the most because at least they were trying to be creative.

Can you believe I'm not to the main courses yet?  Justin sets them down quickly and makes his escape.  Visually - they were quite good.  2 of our folks got tortas - one beef and one chicken.  They were ""fine"".  Both tortas and the burgers come with fries and the fruit slaw on the side. No one liked the slaw.(Friend said it was more straw than slaw)  To me, it was ok - but not worthy of the large portion it took on the plate.  Would have been MUCH better to just fill the plate with the waffle fries that were actually pretty good.  One person got shrimp enchiladas.  That was pretty good - but could have been done just as well or better by quite a few places in town.  I got the pork loin chops.  Honestly - with this being one at their highest price point, I figured I should really get to see their strength here.  It was pretty.  The two thin chops were cooked fine - but it wasn't cooked IN anything for extra flavor, which pork really needs.  It touted an ""herby garlic, cilantro, lime sauce"".  It was green, and not bad, but with those things you would have thought it might have had more kick.  Or at least flavor. It wasn't bad in a way that detracted from the meal, but it didn't add much.  The green beans were at that same ""fine"" point.  They were very green and looked great.  But beyond the almonds someone threw on top (again, not cooked with at all, just threw on top at the last minute) there wasn't much flavor.  ( I buy the big frozen bag from Trader Joe's, steam them, toss w/ a pat of butter, salt and pepper and they could kick the butt of these green beans. I didn't have that high of a bar, but they didn't even meet it.)

The night was capped with some poor service mistakes.  Several of us had discussed trying a desert.  Instead of a request for desert, we got a check.  We figured it was a sign.  We were dividing the check into 2.  A friend who had been a server suggested that we mark the items that went on a particular card and then it was easiest for them to split the check.  We were explaining that to Justin as he was seemingly running from the table. (Did we have ebola and no one told us?)  When he accidentally put the wrong total on each card, and we asked him to switch the totals, rather than go do it, he was argumentative at the table for several minutes about how he did it right and kept trying to push fault to the friend who handed him the bill. he then stormed from the table (like a 2 yr old) saying as he went, ""Fine, I'll just have to go switch them"".  Yea, that's all we'd been going for.  The whole table felt uncomfortable and insulted.  A friend noticed we were ""dropped off"" to go boxes when all other tables had their food taken away and the server put them in the boxes.  I don't know if we just had an awful server or if he thought we'd be bad tippers (I've never gone under 20% for good service - bad never gets less then 15%) but it will be a long time before any of us go there again.

Needless to say, I'm not a big fan of nachos, but the cheese and shredded chicken really popped. The cheese was melted well and it didn't drag all the other ingredients along while you rip it apart.  My next dish was the Tortas.  Tortas to me is street food, but I totally dig a restaurant that can bring it indoors and make it work.  It worked indeed at Ticoz.  Soft bread and shredded pork; add a little hot sauce and yum!  It was serve with waffle fries; crispy and crunchy.

We were seated at a high top table across from the bar. Our server was a sweet & patient dude, wish I remembered his name! 

For starters we each ordered a margarita & the calamari rings. I thought the margs were tasty (I ordered a passion fruit & a strawberry) but my sis thought otherwise, she didn't even finish hers, bummer. However, we both agreed that the calamari rings were amazing. The best part: the jalapeno lime sauce that came with! After chatting for probably over an hour (my sis is a talker!), we finally decided on our entrees. Traci ordered the grilled peach salad with chicken & I ordered the RPM kitchen bowl with chicken (RPM= rice, pinto beans & meat). Traci loved her salad & devoured the entire thing! I too loved my entree, all the flavors went together so well! We were both stuffed but being the dessert junkie I am I had to order dessert to go. I went with the creme brulee, flavor of the day was butterscotch. When I got home later that night I dug in & it was just ok. I didn't really get a strong butterscotch flavor, which is what I was looking for.

I'm surprised I hadn't written a review yet, which would have undoubtedly been a 5 star review. However, had this past Sunday been my first experience with them I may have not been so hot to go back or recommend it to anyone. 

Its seems like they lost their sparkle. You used to be greeted by a friendly well dressed host/ess, this time we were greeted by a lady dressed in head to toe pink what looked like tennis or work out gear, complete with a sun visor on. When I go to a place that is asking me to spend $9-18 on lunch, in a setting such as Ticoz (which I love how cozy and dim it is in there) I expect the staff to look like they at least put an effort in. 

Our waitress could have given two sh*ts that we were there. We ordered chips and salsa (which used to be free there, but now you have to pay for them, whatev, its $2) It took longer then it should for them to come out. We placed our lunch order and waited and waited. We were there with a couple, my girlfriend and I split an order of fries and the lettuce wraps (both were good) those came out after a good 30 minutes, and it was seriously not busy in there at all. Our husbands food did not come with ours and they were told it would be ""any minute"" another 10 minutes goes by and the waitress comes flying over with their food, doesn't apologies and takes off as my friend is trying to request another drink. 

I've been hearing things here and there on Yelp that Ticoz is going down hill and didn't want to believe it, but after our experience this past weekend I am a little sad to see what has become of one of my once very favorite places to dine at.

I like how they bring chips and several salsa choices to start off... It was hard not to eat too many as they were really tasty!  It was tough to decide what to order as everything sounded delicious!  I loved that they had a variety of salad options as I usually go with salads for lunch.  I finally decided on the hearts of palm salad + shrimp.  The half portion was just the right size for my hearty appetite!  One of my friends had the street tacos and the other had the Ticoz chop chop salad.  We were all pleased and went home feeling extremely satisfied.

I would like to go back one evening to try their sangria and sample some of the other things on the menu.  The guacamole sounds awesome!  I like Alicia B's idea of going with a group and sharing a bunch of different items.

For those interested, here are a list of the health department violations from this place:

LOL!  Perhaps if your restaurant spent this much time in safe food handling, you wouldn't have so many people complaining about sanitation.

You have some great excuses,and I know you'd like to think they're valid.  I have never known a soul that works at your place.  Nice try, however.

And linking the TRUTH about your restaurant is not slander.  Please educate yourself on the meaning of the word to begin with.  ;)

Since you've started posting, I've received over 25 emails from viewers of the review thanking me for my honesty, and blasting you for making yourself look foolish by your petty responses to a customer.  I'm sure you are aware your nasty approach here only supports others claims of the management and staff being surly and bitter.  Or, maybe you're not.  ;)

So, do feel free to try and attack me and discredit me further.

The BF and I went to try this place tonight as we had a deal from phoenix Voice. We were sat by the very nice bartender (but in the dining room). This restaurant is so cute! The decor is so classy looking and they really took the time to make the details nice, including the bathroom sinks, which were really nice looking. We got a pitcher of the white sangria, as it was half off and it was really good! Our waiter was very attentive... at least at first. He made a great suggestion for my dinner, the blue corn enchiladas... holy crap, it was sooo good! My only complaint was when I said I wanted to get just the one enchilada he was a little pushy on trying to get me to get the full dinner.... I wanted to make sure I had room for dessert, so I got the smaller plate, and despite his pushing, I was glad I did because it was the perfect amount for me... no need to spend an extra 4$ on food I couldn't eat. I know he wasn't trying to be pushy, it just came off that way a little. The BF got the burrito, which was just alright. Nothing like my enchilada. Whoa... the green sauce and the cheeses and chicken all blended together in amazing deliciousness. Please order this dish. super Yum. I also got a side of the guacummus.... genius! This stuff was so tasty and something I have never heard of anywhere else. So then we wanted to get the dessert I was saving room for (although there wasn't much saved) and asked for the waiter's suggestion. He suggested the tortilla pudding... which is what we were thinking about, but then remembered they ran out! Noooo!!! That was such a let down! We didn't end up getting dessert as that was what we really wanted. It was probably a good thing though.

 So finally we go to pay and they manager was unable to find my name on their Voice deals list at first... then the manager found it, but accidentally took it off of the table next to our's bill and charged my card for the remainder of their bill.... oops! It took awhile for anyone to come around, as it had gotten fairly busy and there was only one waiter. The manager was really good about fixing the problem, so that was nice.

Best waffle fries on the planet. Hands down.

Best Happy Hour prices in Phoenix. Hands down. 

I mean, can you really resist $3.50 Mojitos and Margaritas? I didn't think so. 

The decor is inviting, very trendy (in a not-trying-too-hard way) with vibrant reds. There's a TV over the bar, for those who can't get enough sports updates. There's an outside patio, too. 

The Resto-Bar is called just that, for it's divided. You walk in - to your left is the bar/patio areas. To your right is the dining area. 

The menu is loaded with delectable entrees, salads and appetizers. It would be difficult to decide what to get. The best thing is to take a group of friends and sample each other's. 

The staff behind the bar are very nice... and easy on the eyes, of course. But I'm not complaining. 

Did I mention their fabulous waffle fries? My mouth is watering just thinking about them...

I love the atmosphere and decor of the bar. Love the down tempo music. Even the outdoor patio looks awesome. 

The mojitos are still the best I've ever had. They've changed up their menu slightly. There are plenty of flavored mojitos to try, including blackberry and mango. They nixed the Ginger Lemon martini, though, so when I asked for a Ginger Lemon mojito (a made-to-order drink I had the last time I came here), I was happy that the bartender obliged. The server seemed a tad put-off by my request. I might have irked him a bit, but I had to try the Ginger Lemon mojito to see if it was as good as I remember. It was probably the last one I'll ever had... so it was a bittersweet moment for me. My 2nd mojito was the mango one. It was tasty, but I think I prefer the more traditional (less sweet) drinks. 

My HH pal and I ordered the two burgers for $5. They are 1/4 lb burgers and come about medium well. Mine was super salty but tasty. We also ordered a basket of their waffle fries. Damn good!

There was so much buzz surrounding it for a couple months after it opened, and some of my gay friends still rave about it. So I finally tried it on Saturday for lunch and was a little dissapointed.

First off, I don't care if you are gay. That is absolutely your choice and I respect you making choices for yourself, but please for the love of god hire ONE person that still talks like he has a pair of testicles. Every waiter, bartender, and host that we encountered was almost inaudible and spoke in such a high tone of voice that I actually thought I was speaking to women.

Secondly, being the only table in the bar (+1 table in the patio area) should mean that we get decent service. Watching 4 staff members stand in a close proximity circle behind the bar talking about how much they drank last night and forgetting to bring us more drinks, a bill, my credit card back after I paid the bill, etc. is a little disconcerting. Perhaps even more disconcerting than my lack of ability to spell or my run on sentences. 

Finally, when I tell you that I think your Pork Chile Verde dish has an almost inedible salt content, and you reply back to me ""I've been telling them that for a long time and they wont change it,"" it's obvious that something is going wrong in your lines of communication. You wouldn't tell me that if a) you didn't also feel that way or b) you've heard other customers say the same thing. Regardless, what you should have said is ""well I appreciate the feedback sir, may I offer you another dish with a lower salt content? and I'll be sure to let the chef know what you thought as well.""

Ticoz used to have really good lunch specials, tortas, barbacoa...mmmm....but now, you just have to order off the regular menu....and they raised the prices! I have a hard time paying $12 for a burrito at lunch, even if it is delicious. 

So we order off the regular menu and I await the delicious pineapple salsa and chips.....and wait....and wait.....where is my salsa? Well, we find out, that they don't give it to you for free anymore, you have to order it! What???? First you raise the prices and then you take away the free salsa....no bueno!

Crystal, the new bartender, is AWESOME! She is right on top of drinks, food, everything! I'm sure the other bartenders are great as well, just haven't had a chance to meet them yet. When we were there the staff was setting up for a very large birthday party that was supposed to be outside on the smoking patio. Then it started raining. Instead of displacing those of us in the bar, they were able to accommodate current customers and the large party in the dining room. The owner was right in the middle of the mix helping to move things around and get set up rather than barking orders. He seemed to create more of a family feel with the staff and customers, thus making everyone feel comfortable. 

We ordered the quesadilla and the calamari. The onion-ring-looking calamari has this very light breading that was just perfect. The quesadilla was huge and filled us up quickly. There is a red salsa-tasting sauce that comes with the calamari that was very good. The other sauce (not sure what it was) didn't compliment the calamari very well. Crystal suggested the chipoltle crema sauce, which went with both the calamari and the quesadilla. I have had the chips and salsa before and that's definitely worth trying as well. All the apps are 1/2 off during happy hour.

I had two cheese enchiladas ($9.95) smothered in the vegetarian red sauce, which came with rice and beans-I got black beans. The portion was large, and the food was great-the flavors were bold, and everything tasted fresh.

I have been craving your chips and a margarita.  We started with those and our server suggested adding the plate of dipping sauces.  They were really yummy.   We chatted for quite a while and our original server was very attentive.  We ordered dessert and more drinks, then settled in.

Although we didn't see it happen, our server clearly experienced an alien abduction. Poof, he just disappeared.  Once that happened, the.   service.    just.     stopped.  I had to walk up to the bar to get more drinks.  No biggie but we were less than 10 feet away from 2 managers and 2 people behind the bar.  I asked a passing server for more water and got no response, so I got up to get it myself and was asked ""what are you doing?"" by that same server.

The grilled fish burrito contains breaded fish and the breading texture is mushy inside the burrito. The flavor is weak.

The rice is skimpy on the chicken and you are given the option of if you want it spicy or not. It used to just have a nice mild spice to it. Now? Now, it is sweet! Blech! And, if you make it spicy, it's still more sweet than spicy.

# bits of dried food on the silverware
# gents' door sticky enough that somebody might think it's occupied
# seating upholstery is worn, cracked and tattered
# wall to wall kitsch not dusted recently
# staff congregates at the host stand chatting and leaning
I'm not supposed to care because you don't.  But I do. It means you don't care about my food. And it shows. 

## open face tamale is not a tamale, it's a hot mess. Stop calling that mushy pile of barely-cooked masa a tamale. 
# queso sauce is a wet mess (I'm always wary when the menu has to change languages from English to convey the description). Glad I asked for it to be left off.

They have quite a few vegetarian options that can be made vegan if you know how to order it.

We stopped by on a Sunday afternoon for our very first dining expierience.  It was fairly nice and warm out so we opted for the patio, everyone was very friendly and we were seated promptly. The place was not super busy but most everyone was on the patio and I liked the vibe. We saw others sucking down mimosa's and mojito's so we thoughy why not? We each ordered a glass of the passion fruit sangria - it was excellent. You also get a LARGE glass of sangria, not a small wine glass or cocktail glass they serve you in a more inferior establishments.

I had checked some Yelp reviews quickly(don't you love Yelp mobile?!) and figured out the corn waffle fries were a must to start with, very tasty, fresh and not the typical thrown-in-a-fryer-frozen taste. 

I had the Grand Burrito with veggies minus the cheese. I am not a big coleslaw fan but the burrito came with the passion fruit slaw and I promptly scarfed it all down, delicious. I was expecting the burrito to be good but it was good in a different way, you could tell it had some different spices and seasonings going on then your standard Mexican-style fare. I might have picked up some curry or coriander, whatever it was in the yellow rice it really set the burrito apart. 

Overall this place was great, no complaints besides maybe a few more items I could veganize without completely destroying the items. We will definitely be back for drinks some evening.

So of course, I jumped at the opportunity to purchase a Groupon that included an appetizer, and wine and entree for two!

We started with the standard chips and salsa as well as the Shrimp Ceviche. The chips are half corn tortillas, fried, not your basic triangle shape. The salsa was flavorful and not overly spiced. The Ceviche, however, was very disappointing. Very few shimp, and they were the teeny tiny ones - and swimming in juice. There was a lack of balanced flavor overall - too citrusy, too cucumbery, too....something. Not a fan.

I was expected a glass full of fruit as is customary and there was one tiny lone piece of peach clinging sadly to the bottom of the glass.

I typically shy from boring chicken, but the tinga was surprisingly my favorite! The other two were good, but could have used some contrasting flavors to elevate the flavor profile.  However, at $2 per taco, you can't beat it! The sangria was tamely tasty and refreshing, while the guachummus (?) app was equally yummy and unique. I've never met a salsa I didn't like and we even ordered seconds! Service was perfectly attentive, while unobtrusive.

Here's a brief rundown-  1st visit I shared ticoz burgers had a Deep Blue salad.  Divine.  Loved the Sangria.  2nd visit I took my 12 year old, who had the palm frond and I the Latin passion salad.

3rd (or 4th)  visit- with friends, had a couple mojitos and shared pork tostaditas, green corn tamales, guacahummus, and chop chop salad.

Last I recall- this summer- met my sis, we had a couple mojitos, shared 2 ticoz burgers, tostadillas and lettuce wraps.

Food is consistently fresh- wait staff is friendly and attentive, and the environment exudes an ""all are welcome"" feel.  I appreciate the electletic melding of foods and think that their chef is a forward-thinking risktaker.  If you want prectable, go to Applebee's.  If you want something more cutting edge, Ticoz is it.

Met my friend Mike E. (shout out to an elite yelper from Seattle in our area for the week!) for drinks and dinner on a Wednesday night and it was ideal.  The patio was full when we got there so we had a drink in the bar area first.  Great drink menu...almost too many choices!  I had a beautiful blood orange martini that completely hit the spot.  We also had a sampling of the 3 salsa choices which were all quite unique but as you have all commented, the tortilla chips left a lot to be desired.
A spot opened on the patio so we moved our drinks outside and decided on dinner.  I went with the delicious grilled peach salad with chicken and found that even after an intense yoga class, the half portion was plenty.  As for my dining partner, he went with the servers suggestion and enjoyed pork chops with green beans.  Needless to say, we were both members of 'The clean plate club.'

Where can you find Imperial beer, other than Costa Rica, Bevmo...Ticoz.
I only had time for calamari but it was prepared nicely with two sauces, the guacamole/jalenpeno sauce was not that hot but tasted good, the other one was sort of a marinara. 

The menu looks simialr to Southwester/Mexican, not the dishes that I have had in Costa Rica at all but I like that that they they have the idea of Costa Rica in Phoenix. Where is the Tarrazu coffee? you can find it at Wildflower but they don't spell it correctly.

Altough the owners are not from Costa Rica, Plantains with smashed black beans would have been nice to see on the menu, you can find those authentic type dishes at Havanah cafe, but ""no tiene de que qujarse.""

I like the music and ambiance, the bar has convenient seating for a group, and not just tables and chairs. The wait staff is very attentive, but should have told me the happy hour specials as I was alone with my computer and ended up paying full price for a beer and appetizer at a dead time of  the day.

I think that  I'll have to bring my husband to try the paella (even though I should go to an Authentic Spanish place) and  get his take on the menu, he's a Costa Rican.

I'm looking for a place that has good chimichuri sauce, if anyone knows, please let me know. The last time I had great South american food was a place called Inferno in La Jolla, CA but they are now a new restaurant.

We started with a appetizer plate that had Guacummus, Calamari, and lettuce wraps.  I love their guacummus it's full of flavor and a perfect blend of two great things.  The lettuce wraps are very good as well very unique with chicken fruit and nuts in them. 

Next course was the salads she got the mixed greens and I went with the Latin Passion which comes with Baby spinach, field green mix, jack cheese, corn, tomato, pinto bean, cilantro, green onion, crispy tortilla strip, and a tropical spicy dressing.  The salad was awesome but also filling which was going to be a problem as I haven't even got to my main course.  

So for the main courses she got the New York strip with chimichurri and grilled shrimp.  They were good and the steak was very good.  I went with the chipotle chicken which was good but lacking that chipotle flavor I was hoping for.  

Lastly we got our dessert to go because we were both just stuffed.  We got the empenada which was great a few hours later.  

We washed down our meal with Laura getting a glass of temperinillo and I had a lychee mojito and it was sooooooooo good.

Service was good, atmosphere as good, drinks were good.  However, I do have a few concerns.   I had the lettuce wraps for my dinner. I know this is normally an appetizer, but I didn't want a heavy meal.  I asked if it would be enough for an entree and the waiter said for one person, yes.    When I received it, I was a little shocked.  It wasn't  even enough for an appetizer and I asked if it was enough for a meal.  I couldn't imagine people sharing this because it wasn't very much at all.  Not to mention it was $10.  If I paid $5 that would be understandable.

The other disappointment was the chips & salsa.  This is normally at your table minutes after you are seated.  Not this time... We received tortillas wrapped in foil with garlic butter on the side.  I thought that was strange and that now in order to get chips and salsa we had to PAY.  They have had it complimentary at your table ever since they opened, and now returning guests should not expect his anymore?  Not very impressive and it seems a little desperate to save dollars.  

Like I said, I really like going to Ticoz, and enjoy the flavors and food they offer.  I just hope they don't go down the road of cheapening the restaurant by being obviously budget conscious.

Service: The first time we went, we had a new waitress. She didn't seem to know that much whenever we asked her questions, but she was friendly. We had better service the first time we went in there than the second time. Today our waiter seemed like he didn't want to be there. It took him almost ten minutes to acknowledge us after we had sat down. We waited with our menus closed for almost as long. And I would have understood had it actually been busy in there, but it wasn't full. There was one large party in the back, but they had just finished right as we got there. So I don't know what his excuse is for being negligent with us. He also came around about 10 minutes after we ordered, and asked us if we were ok for now. Which made no sense. Why would you ask us that? Where is our appetizer? He also didn't ask us if we wanted anything else before he brought us our bill. Just assumed we were finished. I have to say the service here is not so good. Also, when we went in today the people working the host station were all over the place. They would answer the phones and then talk to the people who came in at the same time. Seems rude to the people on the phone. And they didn't really seem to know what was going on because they would start to take people into the dining room and then change their minds. It was just a mess today. Which didn't make sense to me because they weren't even busy!

Food: Luckily the food is what makes this place worth going to. Both times we have had the guacammus, which is basically guacamole mixed with hummus. So good. It is served with some warm pita triangles and a few chips. I don't know exactly what the policy is here for chips and salsa. They have it on the menu as an item you have to pay for if you want it. But the first time we came in here it was brought out complimentary and today we didn't get it at all. Even though almost every table around us had it. So who knows about that. Both times I also had the sweet corn tamales vegetarian style. The first time they were cold, which made me not sure I wanted to come back here. But today was totally different. They were steaming hot and delicious. The flavors of all of the food has been really good. My husband got the taco salad with shrimp the first time and loved it, and this time he got the house enchiladas with cheese. He was indifferent about these. They had a lot of salt in them, and he can't handle salt too well. But he said they tasted good.

All in all, the food at this place is definitely better than the service, and as much as I want to give this place 4 stars I just can't right now based on what I have seen service wise.

As usual I was craving breakfast this morning and was able to convince the amazing Tony A. to meet me somewhere. He recommended Ticoz. I will go out on a limb and say this probably ties for one of the best breakfasts I've ever had. Similar to Bri D., I am practice a non-tomato diet, and therefore, usually have issues with many places I eat at. I suspected I would have to order everything today minus tomato. However, I was clearly wrong.

Let's start with the salsa and chips. For brunch. Yum. One of the salsas was pineapple based, which in itself would've made me completely content. Had my breakfast not arrived in a timely fashion I would've asked for them to take the other two away and replace it with three bowls of the pineapple salsa. Establishments that can make a great salsa without the use of tomatoes are hard to find. Along with my salsa and chips (I swear I didn't eat the salsa only with a spoon despite my desire to) I had a $2 mimosa. Yep. Only $2. It was super fantastic and had minimal amount of pulp which I also appreciate, not to mention that it looked sunshiny and happy.

I went with the huevos rancheros for breakfast, which is comprised of 3 eggs any way you like, green chili, pulled pork, and potatoes. Um, please Sir, may I have another? It was one of those just about perfectly sized meals (had I not front loaded on salsa and chips) that made me all happy inside as I consumed it. The server told me it would be spicy. It did have a kick, but a little more of one would've been welcome.

Stepping away from the food, the service was prompt and the staff was super friendly from the moment I walked in the door before I could take my sunglasses off until I was headed out the door on my way home. Very conversational. Very prompt. Very much appreciated. The prices were also extremely reasonable. Although the menu for brunch is limited, at least half the items appealed to me, which means there is hope of a future trip.

I adored the laid back decor which was perfect on a Sunday morning. The colors were warm and inviting and the seating was creative. The bigger chairs at the table though almost don't work for short people, but I managed. I want to go back again.

For dinner I ordered the grilled burrito and it almost tasted like something I could pull from my freezer and make in the microwave.

The portions are gigantic but if the foods not very good it's hard to make a dent in your plate. Luckily we ordered a ticoz salad as well and it was hardier and more colorful than the specialty entrees.

The sangria was perfectly sweet and winey at the same time - filled with fruit and so easy to drink I had to drink 2 cups before I realized I was kind of tipsy.

Dinner Menu - So diverse and so good! Everything from burgers to tacos/enchiladas, Asian inspired dishes and salads. My favorite dish (and always a crowd favorite) is the Coconut Ginger Curry.

Eager to try one of their signature drinks, I asked for a recommendation from the server.  He wasn't particularly helpful, so I just picked what sounded good to me, a lychee mojito.  I should have figured out when they offered so many flavor options for both the mojito's and margaritas, that they would just be adding syrup... and I lot of it!  Let's just say I am not a huge fan of overly sweet cocktails, so I was not a fan of the lychee mojito. Next I tried the signature margarita with no extra ""flavoring"". This was much better but still a little sweet for my taste.  For dinner, we started off with chips and salsa. The chips were good, they were thick cut and prepared fresh, but lacked salt.  The salsa was okay, nothing special, similar to what you find at Baja fresh. Unfortunately we ended up with a handful of extra chips and an empty bowl of salsa... and were not offered a refill.  For dinner I ordered the blue corn enchiladas vegetarian and a side of black beans.  This was by far the best part of the meal. The enchiladas were packed with flavor and not greasy at all. There was just enough cheese to satisfy my cravings, but not make me feel guilty about eating it.  Also, the vegan black beans were sooooo good, not sure what the smoky flavoring was, but I want that recipe!  For dessert we ordered a blonde brownie topped with ice cream.  The brownie was great, but the ice cream tasted low grade.  Overall, I would go back if I was in the area for Happy hour, but would definitely not make a special trip to Phoenix for Ticoz again., nan",Toni,366,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

I have been there a handful of times, and finally last night I pulled myself away from the amazing tamales and tired something new. We popped in for some drinks and appetizers and I was very pleased when I found out that Mojitos were the special drink of the day (every Monday all day!). Super yummy! We also got the Guacammus (guacamole and hummus mixed) and it was so good, I wanted to just eat it by the spoonful. We also had a quesadilla with shredded chicken, delish! I ate waaay too much. I couldn't help it though. I asked for a side of the chipotle creme, a must have, to go with just about anything!

When a couple of our friends arrived they ordered some more amazing drinks, a coconut margarita that is out of this world good, and more food. She had the salmon special that looked so good, but I was too full to try and he got the green chili mac'n'cheese, that I know for a fact is amazing!

First, the cocktail, I tried the red sangria for the first time and it was yum! Not too sweet and not to chunky with fruit, as some can get. Very good! Then I pigged out on some seriously delish tacos! I got one beer battered telapia taco, that comes with cabbage and this sauce that is creamy with just a hint of vinegar and spice, perfect! The batter on the fish couldn't have been better, just light enough that I didn't feel jipped on the fish and just enough flavor.

I also had the pleasure of trying my neighbor's Coconut ginger curry rice (w/ chicken).  Yummy!

Our waiter was kind enough to rush over and let us know that happy hour was just about to end, if we wanted to get a drink order in.  Oddly enough, we DID want a drink!  I ordered a mojito, which is always a favorite of mine.  They have all sorts of fancy ones, but I just wanted a plain jane mojito.  Not only was it delicious and only $3, it was BIG!  One of my friends swears by the Sangria, and the other had a fancy mojito and loved it too.

We opted to just split some appetizers.  We ordered the Cinnamon dusted chicken flautas, beef empanadas, and a side of corn crusted (something like that) fries.   The fries were very good, but they were just fries.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I guess I thought it would be totally different than regular fries.  The beef empanadas were very good; it's just shredded beef cooked up in puff pastry.  A very simple idea, and one I plan to try at home sometime soon.  The beef was a little bland, but it was a very filling and satisfying little treat.  But now for the best... the cinnamon chicken flautas.  Hoooooooooooooooooooooooly cow did I love those things.  I've already been back once since, and I know I should try other things, but I couldn't resist.  I've found myself craving them at the oddest times.  They are just shredded chicken wrapped in a tortilla, cooked and rolled around in cinnamon.  Sounds weird, but absolutely wonderful.

I want to give it 5 stars for those flautas and mojitos, but based on the other two items (and until I try something else there) and their terrible, terrible Tostitos tortilla chips, I'm going to stick it at a 4.

Our four top was immediately seated on a lazy Saturday morning. Ok, maybe my Friday wine brain thought it was morning. I'm not really sure. But we were in the market for eggs.

My eyeballs read, ""$2.99 weekend brunch drinks!""
So....I asked what a Greyhound and a Cape Cod consisted of.  I heard mwah mwah mwah VODKA...and then something that sounded like a Bay Breeze. Then Jordan recommend a ""Big Girl Mimosa"". I assumed (incorrectly) this was also part of the weekend brunch drink pricing. 

Yes, the drink was $2.99. However, when the bill came there was a supplement for $1.83 for a shot.  Boo! Hiss! Not really a big deal, but, per discussion with the two other adults at the table, none of us heard the additional pricing for the shot. (Nor did the highly intellectual teenager.) The Big Girl Mimosa was really easy to drink, a bit tart for my friend, as it was heavy on the grape fruit side. (I sucked it down like a camel in need of water.)  See my photo for evidence of empty glass.

Alright, so I ate out today with my favorite family that allows fork-fuls of food to be traded. So I got to taste four very different things. I'd order ALL of them again. Listed in my preference order, here's what we Hoover'd down (like the savages we are, but with linen):

1. Lobster Egg Benedict
2. Mexican Eggs Benedict
2. Huevos Ranchero
3. Hot Cake Trio with Schreiner's Sausage

The Lobster Egg Benedict really is something. It's hard to describe. The sauce isn't too heavy for a benedict and there's plenty of lobster on the plate. I was a bit envious of this dish.  To use my usual sound for food this was ""Hhhhhooooohhhhh my good."" Yeah, that good. GET IT.

The kid at the table went for the Mexican Eggs Benedict. He pretty much orders chorizo at every restaurant in Phoenix. (I don't understand teenagers.) Buuut, if anyone is an expert on chorizo, I'd say this smarty pants would be. He liked it. I did it too. And he even let me take THREE fork passes. The green chile hollandaise is hot but not ""burn your eyes down"" hot.  He called it ""intense"". I agree.

I went with the Huevos Ranchero as I wanted something with eggs over easy and meat. I asked for a recommendation and Jordan suggested this. I absolutely LOVED the spice on everything. The eggs were great. The texture of the stuff underneath the eggs - eh. But I still ate 80% of my meal :) 

If you're in the market for a staple - the pancakes and sausage are WONDERFUl. I put them last as they're basics. But they were really well delivered. The sausages ""spurted"" when poked and ""popped"". They weren't over cooked or rubbery. 

The three stars are for service. I'm bummed about this. Although we were checked on my friend's ice tea was not filled often enough. (It was empty most of the time.) Nor were we asked if we wanted another round of drinks. (Strange!). And then there was the odd thing with the pricing on the Big Girl Mimosa. Otherwise, I'd Four Star this all the way! They have a super cute patio, a nice bar area and plenty of table seating. I'd give this place another go round!, $2.99 weekend brunch drinks! Big Girl Mimosa served by Jordan. Yay!

Our party started off with a pitcher of the White Kiwi Sangria, the Guacamus, and the lettuce wraps. I'm not as big a fan of white sangria as red, and I thought it was good but not great. I've definitely had better. The lettuce wraps were 180 degrees from what I was expecting. (the standard pf chang's type deal) They were basically a fruit and nut compote on a thin crunchy leaf of lettuce. Really really good with the sangria. I'm also not a big fan of guacamole but the guacamus (guac and hummus spread) was pretty good, and my guac loving companions thought it was amazing. Definitely a must try.

For dinner we had a pitcher of the Passion Fruit Sangria, and my wife and I split the Grilled Peach Salad w/ chicken and the Pork Torta. Both were excellent, the Torta especially. It came with huge crosscut fries and coleslaw. The flavors of the sandwich were excellent and I was bummed to have to share half of it. The sangria was pretty good but with all the hype about it being the best sangria ever, I didn't think it was quite to that level. But still, yum.

Our service was a bit slow but our waiter was super friendly and the 3 women in my party all thought he was ridiculously hot. Later in the evening he spent some time chatting with us at the table, and told us that the bar side of the restaurant is a lot of fun later at night when the restaurant side clears out. He did however forget to bring us the extra pita chips we asked for to finish off our Guacamus, which made me a sad panda. The prices for the food were pretty standard, although I thought the $26 for a pitcher of Sangria was a little steep.

I wish I could give Ticoz 3.5 stars because it really is better than your standard 3 star but not really quite up to the 4 star level that most of my favorites are.

Our server was super nice and pleasant, and paid us just right amount of attention. We arrived a little after 7 on the Saturday night and were seated right away.

It was like drinking a watermelon jolly rancher, and I liked that it came with a slice of watermelon which I enjoyed after I finished my drink.

The service and management are absolutely atrocious. Once we were rushed through our meal because we were sat near closing time. That time it was not the manager doing the rushing. 

Even better, on Sunday of Memorial Day weekend, myself and my girlfriend brought another couple that we had told about Ticoz. We arrived at 7:30 and the front door was open. The special board listed some excellent specials, some kind of Pork Chili Macaroni and Cheese (there Mac n Cheese is phenomenal!). After looking at the board and discussing seating amongst ourselves, the manager approached and told us the kitchen closed 45 minutes ago and they were closed for the evening. 

Come to think of it, when we pulled up a car was pulling out after a driver got in. Also, as we left another group (5 nurses) showed up. as we got in our car another two vehicles pulled up. We counted 16 people they turned away in the 5-10 minutes we were there. I made snide remarks to the manager he exclaimed, ""We had no one here for 3 hours!"" Which bothers me for two reasons: first, it is very hard to believe and I think he was lying; second, of course you wont be busy on the Sunday of memorial day during the regular dinner hour. Everyone was at barbecues or pools. However, the late dinner hour will be busy. This has been true for bars and restaurants for a long time.

HjhR3u17OjxD4s8t3toTfg,FUI-hWH_bpis7AKZTWenUQ,2009-07-23,6.0,5.0,4.0,7.0,"In a city teeming with Mexican and Spanish cuisine, Ticoz offers more.  Its melange of Latin inspired dishes, lovingly prepared by Chef Holly Gibson, offer a variety of flavors from Puerto Penasco (Ticoz Street Tacos) to the Caribbean (Coconut GInger Curry Rice).

I had the opportunity to speak with Chef Holly when coming here for a ""YAP."" (Yelper Appreciation Party)  Invitees were lured by drink tickets and a specially prepared spread.  Ticoz' reputation had previously awakened my culinary curiosity, so this was my first experience of the restaurant and its food.

Ahhh, the sight before me when I walked into the restaurant brought back visions of nights in Puerto Vallarta; ordering tacos and tostadas from street vendors at 2 in the morning.  Or was it the talk I had with Chef Holly, when she talked of her inspiration for one of Ticoz Signatures?  Though she grew up in Arizona (so rare, i know!) she spent much time in Mexico, vacationing with family.  It is here where she discovered the ""street taco"" and brought it back to Phoenix. 

I was to enjoy four of these ambrosial tacos the night of the event.  House braised meats on soft corn tortillas, festooned with cabbage, and blanketed with chipotle and an avocado crema.  To give the right amount of tribute, I want to describe Chef Holly's simple secrets to the taco meats.  The chicken is braised  in pineapple and chipotle, the beef in lime and cilantro, and the pork in orange and clove.  These make for distinct flavor combinations, and the juiciest and most tender meat.   The tacos caused a great well being, as everyone was magically transported to the Mayan riviera, with a cold margarita in hand.

I have to digress here, because i just typed one of my favorite words.  Margarita.  I easily enjoyed four of them, to go with the four tacos.  I could not help myself, they were pure titillation.  Not to mention, all the exotic libations are1/2 off between the hours of 4:00p-6:30p.   An unbeatable value, considering the average tropical cocktail here costs only $7.   In addition, the owners were extremely generous in offering its ""Yelping"" patrons two free drink tickets - even for 16oz. of jubilation.  

The drinks deserve a list all on their own:
#1 Coconut Margarita.  (who would have thunk that agave and coconut make great bedfellows? a first for me, now i will never go back to anything less than...)
#2  Passion Fruit Margarita. (a contender for the number one spot. perfect balance of ingredients - so much so that one hardly tastes the tequila and instead thinks they are plucking Maracuya from the vine.)
#3 Blackberry Margarita. (hold me back! I thought there was nothing more divine than a blackberry capirinha.)
#4 Lychee Margarita. (this sweet and fragranced fruit makes the cadillac margarita pale in comparison)

I will not admit to drinking any more than the above stated, but I did sample the other signature cocktails such as the kiwi white sangria, and the peach mojito.  With so many exotic and enticing blendings of flavors, I was overwhelmed.  The list of flavor combinations for mojitos and sangrias, as well as margaritas and martinis goes on...I only wished my liver had not been so well fortified after my drinking expedition.  I would have explored the wilds of this potable jungle, but I settled instead with putting the flowers, that came as decorative adornments in the drinks, in my hair.

So, after that wonderful veer, my focus was back on the food.  Other items my taste buds explored on the generous spread were the BBQ meat sliders, as well as the pork tostillados and guacummus.  What is guacammus?  It is Ticoz famous blend of house made guacamole and garlic hummus - a unique gathering of mediterranean and caribbean.  Go Chef Holly!

What one will find here on the appetizer menu are the characteristic  southwestern and even south american comfort foods such as empanadas (a taste of buenos aires) and flautas.  In addition to the guacammus, the basket of corn waffle fries seasoned wtih lime and chipotle distinguishes this eatery from the rest.

More than a half dozen salads grace the menu, with unique ingredients such as grilled peaches or hearts of palm.  Burgers and sandwhiches are available for the unadventurous, but the signature dishes is where Ticoz defines itself as a Latin Restaurant.

I visited Ticoz based on the many good reviews. FAIL!

Is TICOZ short for TOSTITOS?

Because I swear... the chips served by the waiter were out of a cellophane bag from Costco. 

Margarita.... more ice than anything. Bleh.

Service.... poor. We waited to be seated. We waited to have a drink order taken. Waited to get our drinks. 

The main courses were bizarre to say the least.

The ""tamales"" were more like 2 scoops of sweet corn polenta.The shrimp were in a pile next to it, rubbery, frozen, slightly off flavored. The rice and beans, generic.

The burgers were more like sliders. I think the burgers are prepared far in advance and assembled prior to serving. The bun was made soggy by the watery salsa. The mayo... became watery from the salsa as well. The cole slaw was bleh. The waffle fries were decent.

The waiter was just weird. He was disengaged, unfriendly, and sluggish.

::::Looking Around Confused:::  Is this Omaha?  Or is this Phx, the 5th largest city in the US?  You close a restaurant at 11?  This place should just start getting crowded at 9:30!  Ludicrous 

I decided to cruise over to Ticoz and sit at the bar.  We asked what the specialty was... the staff told us to try the Enchiladas and the Sangria.  And so we did!

Blue Corn Chicken Enchiladas with a Fried Egg on top!   Si Senor!

Nice Sangria selection & I hear the Mojito's are great here.  Try the standard house red sangria with an added shot of Pomegranate Vodka... Es Delicioso!

*the over all vibe and styling of the place. Great decor and great hint of Spanish flair without over doing it. 
*the food was excellent. I had some chips and salsa which were pretty standard. The tacos, although, were outstanding. I had one chicken and one beef. The beef was AWESOME! I am trying to eat red meat only two times per week and I may just have to have both meals be these tacos! 
*The service was great as well. I've heard people say this place is ""gay friendly"". This day and age, ""friendly"" anything is wonderful. But seriously, our server/bartender was very knowledgeable, friendly, and prompt.

We decided on street tacos, and boy was that a good choice. Normally $12, we ordered one beef and one chicken. They were some of the best tacos that I have ever had. Moist and flavorful meat, a smooth avocado sauce coupled with a slightly spicy and smoky sauce. Delicious! My friend and I then got a second round of margaritas. After 2 drinks each and some tacos, we decided that we were drunk and wanted to head to a friend's house. Our tab? $20. $20 for 4 margaritas that knocked us on our ass and an order of street tacos.

I LOVE their tacos; definitely opt for the shredded chicken over the grilled chicken, they are delicious, especially with the olive crema that they drizzle on top. Nom nom nom. Some people complain that chips & salsa aren't complimentary but an order of chips and salsa is only $1.95, comes with really fresh, delicious tortilla chips and three interesting salsas and the waiters will gladly refill both for you. I have absolutely no problem shelling out the $2 for a trio of fresh salsas and good chips, rather than getting stale chips and watered down salsa for free like in many Mexican places. Ticoz is definitely a bit more high-end, alternative Mexican cuisine, but I still think their pricing is reasonable for what you get.

That server doesn't work there anymore... he's now a shirtless bartender at Forbidden (not that I stalked him or anything).

I do love the dimly lit, orange-and-brown ambiance at Ticoz. Look around... you'll notice that EVERY item in the place is from IKEA. (Same goes for sister restaurants Fez and Switch.)

Happy hour includes a pretty generous half-priced discount on specialty cocktails, wine, wells and drafts. For a high-falutin' happy hour barfly like myself, this is an ideal situation. The sangria is crazy delicious here, with three fancy pants fruity varieties. The passion fruit sangria is one of my faves since it's a more traditional take on sangria, although the watermelon blush and kiwi chard are close seconds. The margaritas and mojitos are also pretty ace, with fancy flavors like blood orange.

A couple of apps are also discounted during happy hour for five bucks each. The chile pulled pork soft tacos were so flippin' awesome and filling enough to serve as an entire meal. Their avocado crema and some other type of colorful drizzle atop the tacos were super tasty, as were the pickled onions. The corn crusted waffle fries are also super fantastic. Lettuce wraps, eh, just okay. Interesting ingredients like dried cherries, mango, pineapple, pepitas, and macadamia nuts, with a tangy vinaigrette that kept it from being sickly sweet (as the Fez lettuce wraps trend toward at times-- sorry Fez, still love you!)

The brunch is also a staple for our mimosa-imbibing crew. Two buck mimosas? Yes, please. They'll sub cran too if you prefer a poinsettia. The southwest eggs benedict are my weakness during brunch. Two perfectly poached eggs atop chorizo-lined cornmeal cakes, smothered in chipotle hollandaise. Holy fricken orgazmotron that meal is delicious.

It's like a Costa Rican/Southwestern/Mexican combination of pure goodness.  Yes, the food is quite rich with substance, ingredients, a blend of unique combinations, yet every bite of every entre I've had over the years has been incredibly good.  The chips and salsa are great too.  Also, if you have any room left in the tummy, definitely get the banana/chocolate tortilla -- holy crap.  

Okay, the service is usually really good and sometimes it's slow as can be -- they always seem to be moderately busy during the weekday and crazy busy during the weekend.

I was hoping to eat here before a Suns game which was why I bought the Groupon in the first place, but never ended up making it downtown in time which might have saved this place a star (you'll see why in a second). 

Excellent food and house made chips (with the trio dipping sauces, yummmm). I had the street tacos, my girl had the Sherry Chipotle Grilled Chicken which sounds a lot better than it looks. We also took advantage of the drink specials of the day. 

The only downside to this place was the wait. It was around 2:00 pm on a rainy Sunday so you would think that we would get fast service. There was a pretty good crowd there, but open tables and they still seemed to take their time. No worries though since it was a Sunday, we were in no hurry and that appetizer hit the spot.

I walked into Ticoz with the same perception as everyone else; 'This place is popular because it looks like a cool place to be seen""  And like many places in Phoenix/Scottsdale, the trendy swank restaurants are more hype than substance. I walked in here thinking this is another place that could serve dog shit but if they dress it up with a nice drinks, good looking people and a Crate and Barrel catalog, it will get 5 stars.

So my wife and I chose to eat here in the afternoon when it wasn't busy. We actually ordered food in addition to drinks. I was shocked. The food was actually delicious....not, not good....delicious. The food has a lot of flavor and is well prepared without it being heavy.  At the same time, the food is still well grounded in Mexican ingredients so you are not eating fru frue eclectic dishes that are designed to be different just for the sake of being so.  Therefore, you won't see Octopus tacos with cinammon salsa...no nothing like that.  I had a wondefully slow cooked  pork that was served in a spicy sauce over cheese enchilada.   They have a fresh citrus Paella that is fragrant and flavorful without being too greasy. The margaritas were disappointing. They were strong with no flavor.  It was like drinking lemon flavored tequila.  HOWEVER, the mojitos were out of this world.

I was curious to see what the fuss is about, so I purchased a groupon.  My boyfriend and I walked over there for dinner one night and were hoping for some really tasty food.  
We were seated promptly and our server was very friendly, our water glasses were kept full and our food arrived fast.  The atmosphere was nice, candlelight, with nice chairs.
I don't like to feel pressured into buying wine, beer or cocktails, and our waiter seemed a little pushy on that front... He almost seemed surprised and annoyed we weren't ordering drinks.

But the main complaint I have is the the food was not very good.  We ordered chips and salsa, and the salsa was bland, kind of tasted like one of those 99 cent cans of salsa from food city.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  I guess I should have studied  the fine print on the menu more.  The server asked if I wanted shredded, grilled, or crispy chicken. I asked for grilled and that added $2.95.  He then asked what sauce I wanted on top, red, green etc.  cha-ching another $1.95.  Not to  be the master of complaining here,  but my $12.95 burrito was now a nearly $18.00 burrito.  I know I had the groupon,  but the point is I should love an $18.00 burrito.  I should go home, think about it, dream about, tell me friends about the best burrito in town, and try to mimic the ingredients to create my at home version.  The chicken was dry, the $1.95 red sauce tasted bland, I kept wishing for some hot sauce.  The burrito was suppose to include some passion fruit sauce... there was nothing passionate about the fruit sauce, I don't think it was even in the burrito.  It was just kind of a bland sloppy mess.
My boyfriend ordered the pork verde enchiladas, and I tried them.  They seemed alright.... I gave him my burrito and he who is in the clean plate club, did not eat it.   Our bill was $40.00 for two dinners and a order of chips and salsa.  The groupon helped, but even for $25.00 I felt like the food was sub par.

The pros: Both times I have been here I have had the pork chili verde. The chili verde is served over two cheese enchiladas with a side of beans and saffron rice. They drizzle a chipotle cream sauce over the beans which is awesome. I found myself squeezing a taste of the beans and cream sauce with every bite I took.

DJIwm4UCnM-SOxXbARjPsQ,FUI-hWH_bpis7AKZTWenUQ,2007-01-08,8.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,"Having recently defected to Central Phoenix from the dairy and strip-mall-laden wasteland that is Laveen, I decided to try a few restaurants in the area that didn't have the words ""Burger"" or ""in the Box"" in their name. Being relatively new to the area and otherwise afraid to attempt to turn left onto 7th St, I summed up the courage one day after having been invited to lunch by a friend and made the mad dash across the street and down to Ticoz Resto-Bar. In the amount of time it took me to turn left I probably could have just walked there, but that's neither here nor there. 

Upon entering, I feel like I have been transported to some urban-cool hipster hangout that actually wasn't situated right next to a brake repair shop. Replete with so-dark-you-can't-see candle lighting and 11 minute remixes of the latest breakout dance track, you have your choice of seating situations. You can dine in the dining room, belly up to the bar for cocktails or brave the outdoors on the patio. 

My lunch companion and I were seated on the patio immediately. I found it odd that there were signs posted to remind patrons to keep the volume of their conversations at a ""normal"" level as not to disturb nearby residents. Suddenly, I'm reliving a moment from kindergarten and being reminded to use my indoor voice. Since I'm now in my 30's and I've finally gotten the hang of that trick, I take a chance and converse with my lunch companion using my normal everyday voice. This is something you may want to bear in mind if you are meeting up with a large group of people after dark, want to sit on the patio and some members of your party are incapable of controlling their screaming and/or giggling.

The menu offers enough variety to not only set it apart from other run-of-the-mill Southwestern restaurants but also makes me want to come back and try the other items at a later date. I opt for the Pork Torta Sandwich this time around, accompanied by a glass of Passion Fruit Sangria. The Pork Torta is served on grilled flat bread and is very flavorful. It's served with a side of what I can only call cole slaw.  The dressing is very tangy and flavorful and a nice compliment to the entree. The Sangria was potent and also went well with the meal, but seemed a little pricey. My dining companion has ordered the Coconut Curry Rice with beef and after sneaking a bite off of his plate when I alerted him to ""something shiny"" in the corner, I find it too is very delicious and flavorful, combining a number of unique flavors to create an altogether different dish than I have experienced at any other restaurant that might serve a patron a taco. 

A good attribute about Ticoz is the fact that it's open until midnight. This makes it one of the few places in Phoenix that doesn't lock up come nightfall (laundromats aside). I work late hours every day and I like the fact that I can still meet up with friends after a long day and sip cocktails without worry of being forced to cram waffle fries down my throat at an unsafe speed before being given the heave-ho, or worse yet, having to go to Applebees. The ambiance is great and the staff is very friendly.

a topping, and they use a blend of fresh cheese and cheese sauce and black beans. I like them meatless best because all of the included toppings are so flavorful on their own. My one complaint is that they're not consistent. Some days I have great nachos and fantastic service, other days I have absentee service and the nachos are sub-par.

We visited on a week day night, and sat at the bar.  Our bespeckled bartender was sweet, sassy, and kept our drinks full. I also appreciated her know what was and wasn't vegetarian, and providing a delicious recommendation for the veggie/cheese enchiladas.

The chips and three kind of salsas were a yummy starter, and disappeared almost as soon as they were put in front of us.  I had a diet coke, my partner a beer, and our two friends went with mixed drinks; everyone was quite happy.

The food? Oh god.  Delicious. The first vegetarian Mexican food I've been able to find in AZ.  Everywhere else seems to have beef stock in their red sauce, but not here.  DELICIOUS! My partner got a chimichanga, and our friend one of the HUGE salads, and were all cleared our plates in no time flat.

Chef Holly wowed me with the delicious food at the UYE YAP at Ticoz a week ago.  So much so that we decided to return for a lunch date.

I was not as impressed on the lunch date.  I had the burgers (two decent sized burgers served on slider sized buns) and subbed green beans for my fries.  The burgers were fine.  The green beans were pretty good but it was kind of difficult getting to them.  I had to talk my way to subbing a vegetable for the fries (I was on a low-carb diet...mercifully done with that) because ""they don't do substitutions""...they ""don't really have vegetables""...""maybe we can do something""...""I think we can do some green beans.""

The decor is creatively put together, the lighting perfect seats surprisingly comfy (no butt cramps! lol)

Just came from a late lunch at Ticoz where my BF and I used a Groupon.  We came in around 2:30 and were asked where we'd like to sit.  We asked for ""the comfiest seat in the house"" and were shown to the cabana outside.   Perfect!  

Because we were there at an odd hour, there weren't a lot of other customers competing for our server's attention.  He was delightful, attentive without being too present.  

The sangrias were really solid - and enormous. Good balance of fruit and booze.  Our server recommended the cocount curry chicken, and with good reason.  It was excellent.  My only complaint is that the chicken was that it was obviously added after the coconut curry rice base. (Which is great, it can be a solid vegetarian option) but the chicken flavor didn't compliment the rest of the dish.  It had a sort of Latin flavor while the curry was decidedly Asian.  It was served with some tortilla chips stuck in the curry, and s it turned out, I ended up eating the chicken with the chips separately, so it was like two dishes in one.  Weird. They were both great, but if I did it again, I would sitr the chicken in to the curry myself and hope that once I did that the flavors would be more complimentary.

BF got the paella, which was a seafood rice dish.  Really really nice.  Excellent choice, and while it was a hefty $18 it could easily have been lunch for two.  Easily.  Between the two of us, we brought more home with us than we were able to eat, as my dish was also absurdly generous.  Smaller portion options would likely have been a good idea, especially for lunch. 

Since we were there for a leisurely afternoon, with nowhere else to be, and reasonable expectations about the food, it was a resounding success.  We lounged, we ate, we used the free wifi.  The check came to $42, which I thought was completely reasonable.  I think that a party of four could have come in and ordered the same two plates, and everyone would have left satisfied., nan",cindi,18,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

She finally came back and took our order and eventually brought our food.

I had the street tacos.  They were a bit bland so I had to liven them up with some of their salsa, which is very good.

sangria- killer, and if i recall correctly they have a pretty fancy happy hour, so i recommend a dd.

guacammus (guacamole mixed with hummus) yes and yes.

ticoz chop chop- i'm a huge fan of salads with lots of stuff in it. i really don't dig it when i get a big pile of lettuce with a few random veggies thrown on top. there are so many great veggies out there. live a little. the chop chop is great, jicama, hominy, chic peas, red beans, black olives, etc. good stuff.

as far as the rest of the menu goes i really couldn't tell you, because for some unknown reason they decide to put chicken stock in about everything, and i happen to be vegetarian. 
my question is this, why on earth would you find it necessary to ostracize a substantial portion of the population to ""add flavor"" to your rice? no one notices anyway! i dont think i am asking too much, really. i'm ok with the fact that there isn't any tofu on the menu (i mean it would be nice, but hey), but can you please leave the rice alone?!?!? seriously. i don't get it.

The atmosphere was lively yet pleasent for a Friday night, you didn't get the sense they were busy, even though the parking lot and valet were full. I do recommend making reservations in advance, just to avoid any wait. The bar and seating area are seperated nicely, and the restaurant as a whole is well organized. 

Bring on the food!!! We started with the fried calimari and chips with salsa. The calimari was standard, nothing really to write home about. However, the chips and salsa were great. The salsa starts very fresh and mild, but slowly opens up with greater hints of heat. Then came the main course. Green Chili Enchilada's with a fried egg on top...could be one of the best dishes I've ever had!! If you visit Ticoz for nothing else than this dish, you will not be disappointed. To accomodate the enchilada's was a great fresh Sangria that changes with each refill, the sign of a great Sangria. 

Ticoz is very affordable, has great food, and good customer service. Go for one dish, go for more, but primarily...GO.

This used to be my go-to spot for great food, friendly people, and a cool (but not too cool) vibe. Sadly, it's become a more pedestrian version of its former hip self. The decor is fine, and the sangria is still delicious, but the food and the mood are in decline. Ticoz used to offer such unique delicacies as cinnamon chicken flautas, beef empanadas (BIG ones...not the mini versions that are more puff pastry than anything else), and cocoa dusted chicken tenders. On the rare occasion that I would foray in the realm of entrees, few things were more delicious than the chicken palm frond. While the food is still tasty, it doesn't seem to dazzle. Likewise, the personnel doesn't dazzle. Not that Ticoz was ever stocked with ebullient, outgoing personalities, but it seems on most nights that the service staff can't wait to get the heck out of dodge. Nobody has been downright rude...but nobody has been particularly welcoming either. I miss the old guard, the old menu, the old Ticoz.

We ordered chips and salsa (they charge for it) and small salads.  Good on both, not great.  

Then Megan and I both got burritos.  Mine was a pork with chile verde sauce on it.  Megan's was a steak with the same sauce.  Here's where it got fantastic.  They were probably the best burritos I have ever had in my life, and I've had A LOT of burritos, being an Arizona native.  The tortillas were huge and very very fresh, the chili verde sauce was also fantastic, so good that I didn't  use any hot sauce, and I ALWAYS use hot sauce.  And the filling, oh, the filling.  A mixture of wonderful tender meat and some kind of corn mixture.  I don't know what it was, but it was fantastic.

The mojitos are so refreshing with the classic mix of mint and lime which makes these perfect for the summer.

 I have a motto that avocado makes everything better and so we ordered the guacammus appetizer and it was delicious and a great portion size.

Dinner?  YIKES.  I ordered tamales which were.....unrecognizable.  I would describe it more as a plop of cornmeal (no corn husks) with some adobo sauce and shrimp dumped over it.  Not appealing, and very heavy.  

Another guest found a piece of plastic in his chicken (when he chewed on it).  In their defense, the waiter, the manager, AND the chef came out to profusely apologize.  It was a really nice gesture AND they took $25 off the bill.  Well handled.

I took half of it home. 

The waitress was very attentive. polite and fun. Kudos!! I bet she enjoyed her nice tip.

Delayed review as my first visit was in August. Happy hour, well...we left happy!

Here it is Oct and I returned with a friend for weekend brunch. DISAPPOINTED!!! I had the Latin Egg  Fritatta. Key word: EGG. It was pretty much all egg with a minute hint of peppers, cheese and sausage. Very unsatisfying! I must say that the peach sangria was still...well...

Matt made our evening special & worth me writing in. To start I requested extra pineapple salsa bc I heard it was yummy. He went above & beyond by bringing out 3 sides of it!!! Secondly my stepmother is a coffeeaholic & her cup was NEVER EMPTY. I MEAN NEVER. Matt ran his butt off to refill our waters, teas, coffee, happy hour drinks. He brought my dad a bday dessert. Overall he did everything right: he was educated on vegan/vegetarian dishes (again a very appreciated asset in Phx), he made great happy hour drink suggestions, he never rushed us or acted like we were inconveniencing him by asking questions etc, food was beautiful, perfect temp and he picked my dad's dish which he ate EVERYTHING ON THIS Plate except the lime rind & loved it. He's got the up sell rule in place bc he brought a dessert menu which we bought 2 additional desserts. He also told us of some promotional offers they restaurant had going on etc. All in all when we return to Ticoz or switch we WILL be asking for Matt.

You can tell they put a lot of thought into their drink menu, the presentation is lovely - garnished with fresh fruit and a silk flower - the drinks are Ticoz forte. 

There's also something magical about their patio.  You get the feeling you're sitting in a friend's backyard, the patio furniture is cozy and makes you want to kick back and relax.  
I don't have much to say about the food, we tried the empanadas and they were good enough, although they could have used a bit more spice.

Whether it's girls night out and sangria/margaritas are on the menu..or you're in a large group looking for a great place to get the night started, you are in luck. 
I'd recommend outdoor seating and if its a short wait before something frees up, don't be afraid to hit up the bar. Passion fruit margaritas and mojitos are yum!
I prefer the nightime vibe thats offered on the patio as opposed to hitting it up as a daytime spot but I've yet to have a bad experience at this place.
Whether it's just the two of you and you're looking for a little privacy or you're in need of a place that can handle a little louder crowd, Ticoz is a prime spot.
Spanish style vibe, great service, delicious/unique menu--what more do you need? Go there on a busy night and you're given a glowstick in lieu of a buzzer.

$2 margarita Wednesdays, of course!
Delicious and strong. We've been going weekly to taste all of the different flavors. The passion fruit one is my favorite at the moment. 

The martini's are also fantastic, but I can't afford those all the time :)

I don't always order food, but when I do I am pleased as punch. I had veggie enchiladas and everything on my plate was delightful. I've also had the caesar salad, which was crisp and zingy and perfect. 

I'm happy with the service. Ricky is my favorite. I also adore the sweet young man who works the bar.

I haven't thrown up in years (literally), so this was shocking to me; however, I can say the food was decent for a burrito and the service was really great from my waiter.  
The waiter suggested putting a white cream sauce on my burritto for $2 more, and I ordered chips and salsa (again, $2 more), but he was right.  The sauce made the burritto even better.  But, then again, maybe it was some cream in the sauce that made me sick?  Regardless, the food is definitely decent here (not fabulous, not marvelous but very good sick or not).
I would go back there if I was in that area again and hungry just to see if it was me or the food I got sick on.
One more thing:  For ceviche lovers like me, don't bother ordering it here.  Why?  Lots of tomato, lots of onion, teeny tiny bit of shrimp and absolutely NO lime or lemon taste at all.  Not even mediocre quality.
Surely cannot compare to the fantastic ceviche loaded with citrus flavor I had at Az88, and for $11 Ticoz should be ashamed of themself.

Went to the hostess stand twice to work out food for the extra guests and the hostess was so hair-brained she kept telling me, yes the chef will be right with you. Finally, 30 minutes later I ended up just talking to the waitress. I told her we needed additional items and that I was happy to pay regular menu price for the additional items no problem.  Well I guess she was put out by having extra people to serve and was smacking her lips, not refilling drinks and was throwing - yes literally tossing down plates of food - at our guests. then she stood up in front of the entire room and read off how much our final check was.

I must say, of the the three restaurants these guys have opened up in the area, this one was my least favorite. If I had no expectations of Ticoz at all, I could possibly have given this place 4 stars, but really, I'd much rather stick to Fez or Switch.

Not to say the food was bad, but really nothing extraordinary. To be fair, my coworker and I just ended up splitting some appetizers, soups, and several drinks, so I can't speak to the ""real food"" of entrees or whatever. Still, the appetizers weren't all that appealing. The queso was a bit too chunky and not silky-smooth as i usualy like - just a personal preference. The meat in the chicken flautas was ground which made it rather dry, and the cinnamon in it really didn't help. The lettuce wraps actually were a highlight of the appetizers, and we did quite enjoy them. As far as the soups, both were a little thicker than we expected, so they ended up being more like stew, almost creamy, though the waitress told us they were rather ""brothy"" when we ordered them. 

The drinks, however, were great. We had a some mojitos and the sangrias, and all were definitely refreshing. Next time, I imagine we might venture to try some actual entrees, but at the very least, this place is a great for some drinks at the bar., nan",Alex,60,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

This is where Ticoz Resto-Bar comes in; located within stumbling distance from the apartment I decided on an early dinner with the full intention of hitting happy hour on a beautiful Phoenix evening.

When I arrived at 5:30 the host informed me that every seat on the patio was taken, and that I could sit at the (empty) bar or in the dining room. Not wanting to be ""that guy at the bar"" I opted for a table in the very dimly lit dining room.

At this point, let's just get the service aspect out of the way... nice guy, very friendly, clearly hadn't seen a one person table in a while. I seem to think that a one person table affords you a unique opportunity to interact differently with your guest. However, I don't feel as though professionalism should go out the window.

The waiter brought my round Tostitos and three types of salsa, which can be characterized as:

1. Hot Salsa - BAD, REALLY, REALLY, BAD. I would rather chug Prego out of a dirty can while undergoing invasive surgery to correct... let's just leave it at that.

2. Pico De Gallo - I was under the impression that Pico De Gallo salsa should be chilled when brought to the table, once I got over the fact that my salsa was warm, this was actually pretty good.

3. Pineapple - OMG, WHY THE HELL DO THEY EVEN PUT OTHER SALSAS ON THE TABLE??? SERIOUSLY, THIS STUFF WAS FANTASTIC!!

Shortly after this I ordered the first of what I expected to be many mojitos, at 1/2 price I was ready for an enjoyable evening with my new vice the mojito. Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the outcome. Maybe I should have read the menu a little closer, but the mojito was nothing more than brown sugar water, maybe some rum and a smattering of mint leaves. I drank about 1/2 and decided that it wasn't worth finishing. They clearly need to learn a better simple syrup, or buy the pre-mixed Bacardi Mojito, they'd be better off.

Now in all fairness, I ordered cheese enchiladas for my dinner and they were actually VERY good. Though it isn't very hard to mess up such an easy dish. I was impressed with the amount of cheese that was used as well as the decoration of the plate. Can't say the same about the rice (tasted like it belonged not in a Mexican restaurant but rather a bad Indian restaurant) or the beans, which were just sort of there.

Overall I am disappointed with Ticoz, even though they are owned by the same people that own my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. They obviously have some work to do in this direction before I will be going back again. So I will continue to find a way to live off FEZ alone, or at least until I can muster up the courage to try something new, again., nan",Matthew,54,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

My first time at Ticoz was last summer for a birthday happy hour.  It was hot and sweaty, but I had a great time.  About 10 of us gathered on the patio and talked and laughed until the sun went down.  I've had quite a few happy hours here and 1 lunch and one evening meal.  The lunch was amazing!  I don't remember what it was called, I believe ""palm frond chicken"" or something to that effect.  Their chop salad is to-die-for with a light dressing and corn, garbanzos.  Just amazing.  Their service is always great and when I was going in regularly they always remembered me and knew what my friend and I wanted to drink.

Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar, which is small - but sufficient.  There are no TVs, which is good if you want to socialize and don't care about sports.   The music was great, and I immediately felt at home when I heard Los Amigos Invisibles playing :)

The bartender and rest of the wait staff were pleasant and efficient.  They were cute too, but I immediately knew I was in a gay-friendly establishment so they were unattainable.  But regardless of their preference, Michael was particularly nice and chatted with me telling me about various places to go for fun in the area.

I have been to Ticoz a number of times, and really the only reason I return is due to a friend inviting me to go to breakfast or, like the last time we were here, their birthday dinner. The first time I came here was almost 4 years ago, and the last was about a month ago for a birthday. All experiences about the same - actually, no - I'd say they have progressively gotten worse. 

I know it is a popular spot, and I won't argue with someone who loves this place, but I find it a bit confused and overpriced for the quality. It's cute, I suppose, for a CenPho spot. (I may be putting down some CenPho spots that really make the effort!). But I would have to say the food and drinks here are about as tacky as the interior decorating. I cannot remember having anything I really felt was worth finishing the plate here. I had a chicken burrito last time which was pretty bland, served with some sort of BBQ/refried beans that confused my mouth and the rest of the dish. I will say, I like the little cornbread/cake scoop you get on your plate. The most memorable thing I have have eaten here. 

We also ordered their flavored Sangria pitcher ($25!!!)...a huge pitcher that is really just about 3 glasses total due to the amount of ice they use in both the pitcher and the glasses, and tasted like grown-up KoolAid as if the flavor came from some sort of Pucker's additive. Actually, I remember going to Ticoz for the first time for their Martini night and I had to send back 2 of them because that's all they were, vodka and Pucker's. Gross. 

This last time we were here, for the friend's birthday dinner, we had a large group and were sat in the corner booths. Seating was fine, we knew we were a large group, but we felt like we were a burden for the server and felt more processed than really served. I mean, from my experience in service, you work a large group for a tip but our server had zero personality with us and made me feel like I was on a field trip, not at a birthday party at an adult restaurant. 

My last last review (for TeePee's) actually cited this experience. We dined at TeePee's Friday, and then Ticoz Saturday for the party and we both highly agreed that, though they are very different in ambiance, style, food, etc., we would much rather go and eat at TeePee's again, spend half the amount of money and enjoy ourselves.

We'd like an appetizer on one but not the main course or vise versa.  When we saw Ticoz, we wanted one of each appetizer, main course AND dessert!   We truly couldn't decide on the appetizer so we each ordered the Cesar salad with lime chili dressing and then we shared an order of the calamari off the menu with probably the best dipping sauce I've ever had .... it was a jalapeno lime sauce.  YUM!  My daughter had green chili mac and cheese (does it get much better than that?) and it was a HUGE portion.  Most of it went home for her lunch the next day.  I opted for the blue corn enchiladas and they did not disappoint.  They were accompanied by PERFECTLY grilled zucchini....not too mushy, not to crisp.  Delicious!  Each of the dessert choices sounded great but neither of us could resist the Kahlua creme brulee.

We started with some calamari, and they were tender, made with panko bread crumbs.  The calamari wouldn't stand out on it's own except for the two dipping sauces that came with it.  The green, creamy one had a little too much kick for me (I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy), but yet I couldn't stop eating it.  The other sauce with it is tangy but not spicy, so I used that one to take a break from the creamy one.

I had the green corn tamale enchilada, vegetarian style.  It was AWESOME!  It was flavorful, and the sauce they have enhances it.  (I think it's the same tangy sauce served with the calamari, but it seemed better on the tamales than with the calamari.)  The zucchini was grilled and tender, and it actually had flavor (which sometimes vegetables don't).  I'm not a black bean fan, but I ate all of them because they were tender and flavorful, and I liked the sauce they squirted on it.  The rice was also really good and not hard or dry.  I don't know if I will try anything else on this menu because I liked it so much.

For dessert, we had churros to celebrate my friend's birthday.  They were hot and crunchy with copious amounts of sugar, and drizzled with chocolate and served with vanilla ice cream.  It had a little too much sugar for my taste, but I do love any fresh, hot churro.

The server was super nice and he made sure to keep my water filled.

Overall service was ok but not great, the food was good, and the decor/ambience was a bit of an enigma.  It was kind of odd that we had to specifically ask for a desert menu as our server was trying to give us the check--almost as if they wanted us out the door!

My only real complaint is that they charge for chips and salsa, and the salsa is relatively mediocre.  In my opinion chips and salsa is such an integral part of eating at a Mexican restaurant I put a lot of weight on it.  It just sets the stage for the meal...and shouldn't be that hard to get right!

qDr5sH0huEO0CW8DwAf7NA,FUI-hWH_bpis7AKZTWenUQ,2012-04-19,0.0,0.0,1.0,6.0,"A few weeks ago, I went in for a lunch to use a Village Voice Deal $15 for $30 I purchased. I ordered the Grilled Burrito with no dairy, topped with red sauce, with a side of guaccamus. The server suggested grilled vegetables inside, so I agreed. When my order came out, I reminded the server for the side of guaccamus, and she told me the cook put it inside on accident. I said it was fine, and proceeded to cut into the burrito. Inside I discovered no rice, a few beans; basically a grilled vegetable runny guaccamus mess. She came by so I apologized for being difficult but pointed out this is not what I ordered and wasn't what I wanted it. She apologized and told me the cook had made it wrong the first time, so this was his second try, and she took it back. Once my food came out, the burrito has shrunk half to its original size, but it was 2:30, so I thanked her and ate it anyway. She took my burrito off the check; so once again, I had the Village Voice deal to use.

Yesterday, I called and told the woman on the phone I had the coupon and I wanted to place a to-go order. I ordered the to-go guaccamus, which is on the menu under A La Carte. I've ordered it before, so I know it comes in a large container. I also ordered chicken lettuce wraps; the woman on the phone said I could get the lunch order for cheaper and half the size. Since I was only ordering for myself but looking to spend $30 on the coupon, I agreed with her suggestion. So as a second thought, I told her I would take the Taco Salad as well, no dairy, dressing on the side. She asked if I wanted chicken, and I calculated that this would put me over $30 so I could run a tip on my debit card, so once again I agreed with her suggestion.

When I got to the restaurant, I presented the girl at the bar with my coupon and as she was giving me a receipt for $27, I was bombarded by a flustered, rude older man in a dress shirt practically shouting at me it was dine-in only. I explained to him that I had been there before to try and use it but my order was wrong, so is there anyway I could be made an exception? He grabbed my receipt and went to the register, and brought me back a receipt for $2, saying the order went over the total. I felt bad so I tipped her $7. He walked away and I reminded her I told her about it on the phone: she took the blame and apologized. I was really uncomfortable so I went back to my car. Before I left, checked my order.

The first box had the half order of chicken lettuce wraps: check. The second was the taco salad, which appeared to me to be iceberg lettuce and grilled chicken on top, with no much else. No dressing. Then I opened the third container, which had one side of guaccamus and a million fried wonton chips. So I went back inside because the one thing I really wanted, the to-go guaccamus, was wrong. Once again I was bombarded by this older man, yelling at the server across the bar she would have to ring me up separately, while she told me that I ordered the guaccamus a la carte, and so that is what I ordered. My receipt was still on the bar, so I opened it up and looked at the bill. I had been rung up for a full order of chicken lettuce wraps, the taco salad plus chicken, and one side of guaccamus, which obviously is not what I ordered. At this point I was starting to get angry so I just grabbed my food and left. It was once I got back to my office that I realized I had paid $9, on top of the $15 I already paid for my Village Voice Deal, for a side of guacamole, some wontons I didn't want, three small lettuce wraps and the worst salad I'd ever seen.

If you happen to have food allergies, things you avoid on principal, stuff you hate, or are just generally picky, this is the place for you.  Saturday night found me with two wonderful friends looking at a menu that was overwhelming.  The whole experience started much as every restaurant experience starts.  Greeting, seating, menus, panic attack.  The server (who was lovely, but who's name I cannot remember) came by to ask what we would like.  Given that all of us have some dietary challenges, we start throwing the questions at him.  He doesn't know the answers, but he vows to figure it out. Usually, this does not end well, see the open letter to our sandbar server.  We just get back to our conversation when chef Holly appears at our table.  Everything on the menu is her brainchild and she knows exactly how to answer every one of our questions. 

Not only did Chef Holly answer our questions, she created an entirely new dish for one friend (it was incredible), whipped up a lemon apricot vinaigrette salad dressing with enough for leftover containers, and took back my chicken when it came covered in parsley.  All this is impressive, but what made the experience incredible was her attitude.  It was obvious that she was excited about food.  She saw the challenge in creating something for us.  She told us that no one has ever gotten sick from her food and she was going to make sure we weren't the first. 

In the end, all the service is amazing, the atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is great.  But the food is incredible!!  This is pretty important, since we were there for the food.

Since going to Ticoz for our first date, my wife-to-be and I have eaten at Ticoz many times for other special occasions.  The food, drinks. and service are always top notch.

This review is to call them out for yet another wonderful, more specific, experience in which they helped us to surprise our friends at the VERY LAST minute.

We now live out of town and were flying back into Phoenix to surprise our friends for a few days.  We asked them to attend a ""tasting"" at Ticoz and told them one other couple would be joining them for the tasting and that the Ticoz staff was aware that we were sending friends to the tasting.  

Our plan was to arrive at Ticoz before our friends so that we did not have to involve the staff in our plan.  However, when our flight was late and we had issues with our car rental reservation, we had no choice but to call Ticoz and ask for their help to save the surprise.  

The staff literally handled this situation on the fly (we called as our friends walked into the restaurant!) and acted as if our friends were attending a true tasting.  They provided them with the delicious guaca-hummus and salsa assortment and mini-margaritas for tasting.  They even went as far as to describe the ingredients and how each dish was created.  They were able to stall our friends for at least 20-30 minutes until we finally made it to the restaurant for the surprise!  To top it all off, they offered us churros for dessert to commemorate our occasion and our wedding engagement.   

Afterwards, our friends told us that they had no idea they were being stalled and that the staff handled the last minute situation like pro's.

We could not be more thankful for their help when given this difficult task, as it made our long awaited meeting with out friends happen.  Many thanks to a wonderful staff for ongoing service and food.  Any time we are back in the area, we will be sure to stop back in for blue-corn enchiladas and tamales (among other things). :), nan",Katrina,1,"['Latin American', 'Caribbean', 'Restaurants']",Ticoz Latin Kitchen,"5114 N 7th St

While the general atmosphere was good, it was clear that housekeeping standards were not up to par. It wasn't dirty per se but for a restaurant you don't want to see a  previous patron's meal (crumbs here and there) in the booth cracks. It was obvious that it was ""cleaned"" too quickly. More like swiped. 

Now I don't know if the young man who served us was a waiter or busboy or some guy off the street because he never gave us his name. Although he was pleasant he appeared to be new. He was still knowledgeable and attentive. He got our drink and appetizer order then served it.  He mentioned that he didn't know where our waitress was and said he'd  go ahead and get our order. 

The appetizer was very good (shrimp cerviche?). Our meal came in a relatively timely manner and was pretty good with the exception of the ""Uncle Ben's"" styled Spanish rice. It quickly became evident that while the entrees were very good, someone in management decided to cut corners with the sides. 

Overall it was okay. A bit overpriced for lunch but still okay. Now i'm not too familiar with the Phoenix area so my daughter and I didn't know about other restaurant options nearby but it was a generally good experience.

When we sat the food arrived in a timely manner. Pancakes and sausage for me. Same for my friend. My other friend had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll. My side of eggs came out quickly afterward. 

I'm starving so I'm diving in to the fluffy (actually doughy) pancakes. I prefer a thinner flapjack with some slightly crispy edges. Sausages. Much like Phyllis Dillers's hoo haa..well...sadly they were dry. And I purposely ordered pork sausage cuz I wasn't in the mood for turkey. 

Now. I'm noticing my friend TRYING to cut up his pancakes. I cut as I go. But he likes to get everything all chopped up apparently. Now he's a big guy. It was hysterical seeing him trying to cut through those DOUGHY pancakes. He gave up midway. Needless to say neither one of us finished our cakes.

The pancakes were served with sausage patties that were pretty big and very tasty. After systematically pouring syrup over every part of this delicious dish, I devoured every bite. But that's not all folks! I also got to try some of Scramble's Santa Fe Eggs Benedict. They were also fantastic - served on a southwestern style kind of corn muffin and covered in a delicious hollandaise. A few bites of that and a couple pieces of potato, and my gut threw in the towel! I pretty much left there happy as could be!, nan",Nader,205,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

Multiple options for bb's ranging from chorizo with jalapeno sour cream to your basic gringo bacon and egg bb. I also love how they will happily adjust your order to your liking. If you want egg whites or crispy potatoes they will accommodate all of your requests.

The concept is great -- order and pay at the counter, then you're issued a number, take a seat in the dining space, then relax and wait for the food to arrive. Or choose to sit outdoors on the patio that is also dog-friendly.

Judging by several quotations of egg humor painted along the walls of the restaurant, Scramble doesn't take itself too seriously. But one slogan on the menu hits close to home: ""We're local and so are our ingredients."" Locally sourced ingredients hits high marks when local businesses need our support.

There are so many tastily described items on the menu that being decisive first thing in the morning is difficult. A case filled with Cinnamon Rolls ($3) may help in the decision-making process. I've met many a cinnamon roll, but I've never encountered one like Scramble's. The addition of lemon juice to the frosting distinguishes what would have already been a deliciously tender and gooey roll. It took everything in my power not to order a six-pack to go ($16).

When I scan a menu I try to find the most unique item. At Scramble, one of those standouts is the Brizza ($8). The unlikely combination of two words -- breakfast and pizza -- make for a creative selection. Smoked Gouda and Cherrywood Bacon atop a tender thin crust are well paired, and there wasn't a bite left on the plate. If the spicy kick of the chorizo with peppers and jalapeno cream cheese version doesn't wake you up, then be sure to add a cup of Bold Bottomless Coffee ($2.25).

French French Toast ($6.50) takes thick slices of French baguette, dipped into vanilla custard then cooked on a griddle. The slabs of baguette were tender and had a certain creaminess that made dunking into the maple syrup a real winner. If you like it savory and sweet, add a side of their Cherrywood Smoked Bacon ($3) to the French French Toast for some fun with your food. Bacon dunked into maple syrup is such a childhood pastime.

Scramble also offers lunch after 11 a.m. with a menu of sandwiches, wraps, soups and salads, but breakfast is served all day. This is great because I could eat one of those cinnamon rolls anytime!, nan",Alexander,676,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

Not so this time, they are still in the mode of adjusting to initial customer comments and the $9 omelet now includes one side AND a bread.  That brings the price point in line with what I consider a regular breakfast choice instead of a special occasion breakfast.

None of that would matter if the food wasn't good.  I had the western omelet with english muffin and bacon.  The bacon is cherry wood smoked and a perfect firm but not crispy.  The omelet had ham, peppers and grilled onions.  And the muffin came with real butter.  I almost forgot to take a picture before I dug in.  All of the food and coffee was good.

On your typical Saturday morning, breakfast joints can be overpopulated and require a 45 minute wait which normally dissuades me from visiting and causes me to just skip ahead to lunch instead. But this morning, I visited Scramble and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that not only does Scramble have plenty of seating to accommodate the mass crowds, but it's an order, pay and seat your self style restaurant so it cuts out the dreaded wait time. Everything on the menu looks delicious, especially the brizza! I ended up opting for the veggie scramble with sun dried tomatoes, peppers and cheese and accompanied with roasted potatoes. But the sourdough french toast sounded so delectable that my friends and I decided to split that as well. I'm glad we make the choice to go big or go home because the french toast was worth every bit! The service was relatively quick despite the crowded restaurant and the food was delicious and steaming hot upon arrival. 

While visiting, I noticed a sign announcing that Scramble is offering unlimited pancakes through the month of October. Sign me up for that! I also enjoyed the serve yourself unlimited coffee and soda fountain. It kept my thirst quenched while filling my belly with the tasty food. Like I mentioned, the restaurant offers plenty of seating and the atmosphere itself is clean and modern. But be prepared to sit in a less than comfortable seat.

The place started getting busy about 3 minutes after we sat down and I discovered the concept works quite well.

So many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.

Corny pun intended, indeed! I ordered this round slice of scrumptiousness with a side of sweet potato hash and the Scramble Latte to wash it down and prevent me from a food coma, so I could have a productive day (...watching football). 

At around 9am, a line already formed all the way outside the restaurant and a bit into one of the front parking spaces. We probably waited about more than 15 mins but less than 21 mins to get up to the order counter. We watched helplessly as we saw other groups of people find tables and save them before ordering against the restaurant's official courtesy sign on a pedestal that tells them not to. Fortunately, by the time we ordered, there were still tables available because people had left, and by 9:35, there was no more line. Funny thing is... right at 10am again, it gets crowded and there's a line. That's because people tell each other to meet at exact rounded times, 8am, 9am, 10am.... If you pick an odd time, it throws people off and it's less crowded. 

Also, thanks to its great location, it's a hot spot for hikers to meet up after doing the trails nearby. There were tons of people after the Race for the Cure today here too. It's definitely a trendy place to be!

I was craving the french toast.  Their version is french baquette, hand cut & dipped in vanilla custard.  And served with a side of applewood bacon.  I also ordered a side of the rosemary potatoes.  I am sucker for potatoes, I just LOVE them.  After ordering, you get your cup and go to the island of drinks (coffees, teas, & sodas).  You get your own utesiles, napkins, etc.  And then pick a seat.  

M picked a 2 seater table.  Sweet!  The employee check on us and see how we are doing.  The sweetest people that work there!!  Our food came and it was pretty good.  One of three my pieces of french toast was on the hard side.  The poatoes were pretty good, nothing too special.  

There was a group sitting next to us (they were split up because of the amount of people they had).  They kept looking at us to move but we did not.  We are enoying our breakfast, we did not even finish our food YET.  Then just just kept looking at us.  Really?  Finally they moved another table so they can all sit together.  I got refills and came back, we chatted for a little bit then another family member was standing over our table.  He asked us to move so he can sit his group.  We just left the place.

I've been hearing about Scramble for months now and I finally made it in for a breakfast meeting today.  I loved it...

The oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen, it was served piping hot with pecans, raisins, and milk / brown sugar on the side.  I also had a side of egg whites done just right.  (I was trying to be healthy since I recently realized I gained some LBS in the last few months).  However, I did have a few bites of my dining companion's brizza - it was also delicious!  The coffee did the job too... I left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too... the perfect way to start my day!

I love the clean, urban feel to this place... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean.  I wish I lived closer to Scramble as it would definitely be a regular in my rotation.

Scramble is one of those places that could probably be my go-to spot if they just had one menu item (preferrably a side) that stood out and that you couldn't get anywhere else. If this item exists and I missed it please someone fill me in...

You order at the front counter and pay then they bring it out to you. This is kindof a saving grace if you are in a hurry.

As sometimes I do, I did a little research on the menu and I knew exactly what I wanted to try. The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, eggs poached lying on top of cured ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotle hollandaise sauce covering the dish, I also switched out the rosemary potatoes for the sweet potato hash, visually this dish looked freaking fantastic, however everything was lacking in flavor and my poached eggs I think came from a mini hen, barely any egg whites and small yokes,  the ham was good, had great flavor, I had high hopes for the jalapeno corn bread, taste buds were expecting to be hit with bits of jalapenos sadly that didn't happen, just seemed like dry corn bread, oh and the hollandaise sauce, have I told yall how much I love hollandaise sauce, oh high hopes for the sauce too, because cilantro, it has its own unique taste and smell and I just love the stuff, I love how it can go from a spicy dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was already perfect! But the hollandaise sauce didn't have the hint of cilantro, and the sauce itself was lacking flavor, so I will continue my search for the great hollandaise sauce in the valley.  The sweet potato hash, ok I had no idea what to expect on this, it was bland like it needed some salt and pepper, but it was fresh, it had mushrooms, zucchini? and onions sautéed  mixed in with  slices of sweet potatoes, never thought of doing a sweet potato like that, now I know, going to have to try it at home! 

I ordered the cinnamon roll too, just to try it, again visually great, but the roll was dry and hard and inedible but the icing was perfect. 

Service seemed to be ok, for some tables they were on it and others it was eh, maybe they could work on that too.

I don't think I will go out of my way to come back, I came, I saw, wasn't thrilled, back to the east valley I went., nan",Monica,764,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

The Santa Fe eggs Benedict features jalapeno cornbread, ham, poached eggs and chipotle hollendaise. Whoever thought to use jalapeno cornbread (they are more like sweet corn cakes) is a fricken genius! The sweetness of the cornbread/ cake cuts through the saltiness of the ham and then there is a slight spiciness from the hollendaise. So many flavors going around in your mouth!!! Absolutely spectacular. It came with country potatoes which were decent but I liked eating them with the Benedict, together, as one   :)   
Scramble is now one of my breakfast spots due to this one eggs Benedict which is the only thing I have tried there. I like the walk up order concept and the modern simple atmosphere works perfectly fine for me. They also allow dogs on the patio which gets me kinda excited to bring one of my little ones (dogs) here!

{Side note: What irked the HELL out of me was watching people bark at the food runners to go back in multiple times for silverware, napkins, etc. GET IT YOURSELF. IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE WHILE YOU FILL YOUR SODA. THESE PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY BUSY. YOU ARE LAZY.}

My omelet had a really tasty combo of roasted veggies, and I loved the way the zingy sun dried tomatoes played off the fresh mozzarella. The roasted rosemary potatoes were tasty enough, although Wildflower's are better in my opinion. Toast was toast. Get your choice of jellies when you go pick up your own silverware and napkins, because you are not a dick and can do it yourself.

The place was slammed by the time we left, but all the staff was still as smiley as can be. I just can't get past that price point though. If we were back in the area and hungry, I'd certainly try it again...just with someone else footing the bill., nan",Erin,301,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

They've only been open since Monday (this is their fourth day in operation) so I expect some adjustments will happen over time... here are my initial thoughts, after one visit:

They've definitely improved the old 1980s Le Peep interior!! This contemporary new look is perfect for the neighborhood! The set up is kind of like Sauce, where you file past menu boards as you approach the register to order. You'll be given a number to place on your table so food can be delivered to you. There's an island station for drinks, condiments (ketchup and Tabasco) and silverware (although the cups are paper). The chairs are silver and resemble plastic lawn furniture but are made from a lightweight metal (caution: they are VERY noisy when they clank against one another as you drag a chair to move it!). Not necessarily a seat you would want to settle into, but, hey! We're here to eat, right? There are large TVs mounted throughout the dinning area which I have mixed feelings about - I get very distracted by the closed caption because I'm sucker enough to believe FOX or CNN when they alert: ""breaking news.""

My lunchmate and I tried one of their ""signature breakfast pizzas"" called Brizzas ($8). A puffy, crust covered with creamy scrambled eggs. Ours was topped with mushrooms and decorated with a few leaves of spinach, fresh sprigs of thyme and melted cheese. While the eggs were perfect, the pizza did not have the flavor punch I had expected. 

That said, the eggs were very good and I'm looking forward to trying an omelet ($9) or breakfast burrito ($7) on another visit. Although, I'm not sure I can say it will be my next one because the cinnamon rolls which are baked fresh daily in house or the pancakes (buttermilk, multigrain, caramelized banana, vanilla peach, seasonal berry, chocolate chip or peanut butter chip) may divert my attention. Also, the Santa Fe eggs benedict ingredients of jalapeno corn bread, blackened ham and chipotle hollandaise are tempting...

Scramble is open from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m. so they do have some lunch offerings (served after 11 a.m.). We also split the simple salad: butter lettuce, tomato, avocado and onion with a lemon vinaigrette. The salad was fine. Tasty fresh ingredients (I spied some more thyme in the salad too) and was chocked full of avocado, but I don't think the portion was enough to satisfy as a meal and that made the price seem a little steep ($7.50).

I'm looking forward to walking to Scramble on a lazy morning and taking advantage of the outdoor seating along 7th Street while I sip coffee, read the paper and chow down on some pancakes.

Hey, Scramble, welcome to the neighborhood! Glad to have ya!!, nan",Christina,471,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

My husband was kind enough to snag a few bites lest I go overboard and eat the whole thing which left me to eat 80% of it. It is $2.89 and a pretty good size cinnamon roll. Before the ""dessert,"" I had the two egg meal ($5.89) which came with toast (I chose an english muffin) and red, rosemary potatoes. I love red potatoes anyway, and to have it as my breakfast potato was a nice treat. Since my daughter already had breakfast, we ordered her a side of the dollar cakes (three small pancakes). I snuck one on my plate, since I love pancakes, but couldn't even go near it after pigging out on the cinnamon roll. As other reviewers mentioned, you order at the front and they bring the food out. Besides a minor incident of the wrong food being brought, our food came out very quickly. The servers walking around were very good at checking on the tables. Oh, how could I forget the soft, giant chocolate chip cookies at the register! Of course I had to get one, although I can't even THINK about sweets after my breakfast dessert. What I need is a good latte to cure my impending sugar crash. But the cookie WILL be eaten later. I really enjoyed my meal here although it is a little far from where we live (midtown Phx).

Scramble is getting 4 stars instead of 3 because I truly appreciate the effort to offer vegan items and how they responded to vegan inquiries. Having said that, a few minor things continue to bother me:

1. I feel like the tofu in the vegan burrito isn't really seasoned anymore. It was never heavily seasoned but I feel like it's gotten a bit more bland and sometimes appears like its just plain tofu heated up. 

2. I feel like the tortilla would be better if it was grilled a bit. It seems kind of chalky and cold when I am wanting it to be browned and slightly warm.

3. The soy chorizo is a nice addition but it's kind of close in texture and consistency to the tofu so it all just blends together. Something like some veggie sausage or tempeh bacon in with the tofu or as an option would be a great. 

It might seem like I am complaining but lets face it, you don't have many vegan options in Phoenix for breakfast. Ironically that might be why I am not impressed as much now as was forced to figure out how to make a mean vegan scramble and vegan breakfast sandwich at home for all these years, so maybe I have just had more practice and now I know what works and what doesn't.

The sweet potato hash is still fantastic and was a knock out addition to the menu (for vegans and omnis!)

I still dig the decor, it's always clean, the service is good, the bathrooms are nice and the consistency issues seems to have gotten much better. Scramble would really be an easy 5 stars in my book with some more attention to improving the vegan selections.

Some friends keep telling me to check out yelp, so now I am, in large part due to a ""breakfast joint"" that I have been frequenting lately, since I've moved to the great state of AZ recently.  

So because I'm new to this I guess I should provide a disclaimer of how I will rate a restaurant: food, service, layout, prices.  Pretty much anything that is in control of the owners and the employees.  Let me be clear, NOT: the surrounding clientele(i.e. kids, loud people, etc.), weather, which table I chose to sit at and cartoons were playing.  You get the idea, I believe yelp is intended rate the above listed items not things that are out of the restaurants control.  

Anyway!!!  I love all of their food, first off the Brizza is amazing, genious idea.  Also, I think their coffee is delicious, it's the perfect strength, and it's all you can drink, perfect!!!! Even Starbucks can't make that claim.  I'm a huge fan of their ""scrambles"", I'm a meat lover type of guy myself.  The cinnamon rolls are scrumtous too.  OHHHH, how can I forget their biscuits and gravy.  MMMMM.  Soooo Good.

On to their staff, nothing but great experiences, I can order fast and take a seat and just wait for my food.  If I forget my silverware they grab it for me! Perfect!

The design of the place is awesome, so trendy, great tunes at the perfect volume.  I need to be woken up in the morning, not put back to sleep so I like the upbeat tempo.  And who can forget the big screen TVs.  For one of the yelpers below: the TVs are always on the same channels so you should know where to sit by the time you get out of the line to order.

The juice seems to be a favorite, as most patrons grab one from the cooler on the way to ordering. If you want to mix up your breakfast routine and try something new, I suggest you try Scramble.

On my way to North Mountain in the mornings I was finding myself driving by Scramble on a daily basis. I was always curious about how the food was there as it appeared to be a popular breakfast joint in the area.

So one morning I decided to stop in for a breakfast burrito. I went in, looked at their menu, and ordered an orange juice and Costa burrito. I was given a number to place on a table, so I found a seat with a nice view out the window -just near the patio. 

The server who brought my food to me was very nice. Very peppy and smily. As was the cashier who took my order, who was also friendly. The burrito was excellent and so there was no disappointment there. 

Overall, I was pleased with the prices of the menu items as well as the service at Scramble. I definitely would come back in the future with friends or after a long morning hike.

I really love and appreciate how accommodating for vegans they are. I love the soyrizo scramble with nutritional yeast and the garlic chili chaluhla sauce. I smother it and it tastes sooooo good that I crave it all week long. I know others enjoy the sauce too because the bottles are always being used, but for some ungodly known reason Scramble decided to stop providing the sauce. WTF man??? 

The cashiers don't seem to be especially knowledgeable about the products and it generally takes 2x as long to order a vegan meal than it does a normal meal.

They also recently started putting in bigger chunks of green bell pepper which I think really detracts from the taste. I have also been jipped on my avocado twice now, and my English Muffin barely toasted. 

I have to admit, the french toast and the English Muffin (when cooked right) have a special place in my soul! And there is nothing better that vegan butter  being readily available.

More knowledgeable cashiers, quicker bus service on a busy day, and a re-introduction of the chili garlic sauce and you will have me back.

2/3 of the menu is breakfast with just a few choices for lunch (3 sandwiches, 2 soups and some salads).

my order arrived about ten minutes later, almost too hot to dig in at first. i sat at the window on a stool, which was quite comfortable, and enjoyed the rainy morning. dug into the hashbrowns first, drizzled with some cholula. they were a lot better than last time, and i enjoyed every last bite of them. as for the burrito, i tried it at first without the jalepeno cream cheese, salsa, or sour cream, because they all came on the side. what was, for one bite, a seemingly bland breakfast burrito, became a spicy breakfast sensation with all of the aforementioned sides spread across it. 

it began to get loud in there, and people everywhere i go seem to have this habit of sitting next to me with their talkative and annoying children when they can see I'm clearly engaged in an intellectually stimulating activity that stands to be disrupted abruptly by your obnoxious toddler. the place is huge, and there are plenty of open seats and cartoons tuned on their abundant flat screen tvs. i left after about 10 minutes of attempting to tolerate messy loud children, and enjoyed a smoke out on their large patio.

I had the vegan scramble with the sweet potato hash.  The vegan scramble was scrambled tofu with tumeric - it was DELICIOUS.  The sweet potato hash was a bit strange at first but very tasty.

Rosemary potatoes were also delicious.  And the whole wheat toast is great - not the generic supermarket quality but a good hearty bread.

The capuchino that I got for free for checking in on Foursquare was delicious (very strong). However, the one negative on this place is that their drip coffee is atrocious - I mean, it tasted like water.  Literally. I tried the Italian and the decaf and both were watery - no taste at all.

Most people don't know but you can switch out your rosemary potatoes for a sweet potato and mushroom hash (IT'S SO GOOD) or opt for the bacon brown (my boyfriend loves these). The bacon brown is a potato cake with bacon and cheese inside. He also loves their sunrise sandwich (opt for bacon instead of sausage). 

They have breakfast pizzas (brizzas), mutli-grain pancakes (THEY'RE DELICIOUS) and tons of other options. They source a lot of their vegetables from local farms and their iced teas are quality!

Scramble away from this place and into your neighborhood IHOP or Village Inn...at least you'll pay less for equally dismal food. I expected so much more from a new neighborhood place, especially one that's gotten some good reviews and publicity. First of all, I like the system of ordering at the counter for casual lunch and dinner places, but there's something about breakfast that it's ill-suited for. Breakfast is just a full service kind of meal, at least to me. The decor/design is certainly nice and modern, but I wish the food matched. With the exception of their ""brizzas"" (breakfast pizzas), their menu items are the kinds of basic things you'd find at any chain (actually, there's less selection than many chains). We tried the pancakes (we asked for 2 buttermilk and one multigrain) with carmelized bananas. They brought out the pancakes first and then said the bananas would just be a couple minutes. When they finally brought it out, it was one banana halved and carmelized, for three large pancakes - terrible presentation. The pancakes themselves were no better than IHOP. The eggs benedict was equally disappointing - they were served in an ocean of hollandaise sauce, the ham was a tad too salty, and the english muffins were soggy. Originally, I thought of trying one of the ""brizzas"" since they're unique to this place, but I'm glad I didn't. The woman next to me was eating one - it was basically eggs and cheese on a raw-looking flat dough. She didn't appear to be enjoying it at all, picking the eggs off and leaving the dough.

My biggest problem with Scramble is their consistency. The food just doesn't come out the same way every time.

My first visit to try the tofu/soyrizo burrito resulted in a burrito that was extra oily and sweet potato hash that was blackened (burnt) and extra oily.

My next visit (today) resulted in a burrito with tofu that wasn't cooked/seasoned as well as the last time (big chunks of white tofu). The sweet potato hash was good this time.

I'd also like to see a bit more soyrizo added to the burritos.

The miniature cup of salsa provided with these dishes should also be increased in size, as it's easy to run through in a few bites.

I still really dig the place, I just hope that they get their cooking/prep down so that the dishes turn out more consistent and better.

Enter Scramble.  Cute place, nice and bright with lots of seating inside and out.  The have large menus on the wall for you to read while standing in line.  They have much to choose from, and for the veg-folk, they have four different vegan options!! I swoon over their vegan French toast, with syrup, Smart Balance, and a side of fruit (but I always order it with the sweet potato hash cause that's better! It's sweet pots mixed with mushrooms and zucchini and rosemary).  They serve vegan items on specific vegan plates and cook with a separate grill, how rad is that?  I truly appreciate their consideration.  Once while I was in there, I had a chance to chat with the owner, and I asked if he was vegan.  He said that he wasn't but that his brother is, so he tries hard to be conscious of the non-animal eating people, and also said that if there was anything that I thought would be good to eat, to let him know and he'd check it out.

Breakfast.  I was hungry by then.
So I go in, and, sigh... I have to stand and study the big plastic menu boards, very similar to Pei Wei's... mix and match, each item priced individually, pick an omelette and add some sides of your choice.... sigh, it's a chain.  Or if it's not a chain they decided that looking like a chain was the way to go.  Not for me.
Interior is uber clean, give 'em that.
Kinda too efficient, too slick.   Midcentury modern styling with the Toledo aluminum chairs, cool colors and styling - they got it goin' on in that way. 
But for breakfast, I just wanna sit down and order off a menu.   This is that ""fast casual"" style where you order at the counter and they'll give you a number you clip to a stand at your table. 
Service was friendly.   The food was good.  I had a veggie omelette, rosemary potatoes and some pancakes.
Oh they blew it with the syrup.  Yes I'm a syrup snob.   Aunt Jemima fans:  don't ever, ever try real maple syrup from Vermont because you can never use that thick gloppy fake syrup again.   Yes, Scramble serves that thick, gloppy fake syrup stuff.  The pancakes were just a little less than ""okay"" - a little too rubbery, a little too thick, a little too dry, and got cold fast.   And that icky fake syrup doesn't help. 
Anyway, this place is okay, but I wouldn't ever go back because it was a looooong drive for me.   I'll stick with my faves: Matt's Big Breakfast, Over Easy, and I'll keep mourning the loss of my beloved Palatte.

I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day! 

On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying. 

My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home. 

Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food. 

I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!, nan",Dottsy,196,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

The food was cooked well enough and tasted fresh, though the rosemary potatoes were cold and not very good both times I went.  Highly recommend the Cafe Caramel Coffee, incredible.

We call a couple popular standbys but there is no way a 45 minute wait will do. We call Scramble and are told it is a ten minute wait. We're just a couple blocks away so we're in the parking lot in about five minutes. Considering the line is out the door, down the sidewalk, and into the parking lot, I'm having second thoughts as we stop at the end of a long queue with a lot of people mumbling (more than a few conversations about how many open tables were inside). An insincerely chipper employee at the door calls for the line to form further down the sidewalk ""so no one gets run over by a car in the parking lot.""

I figure the line must move quickly but, after seeing the line is growing I can only assume that, at best, the wait is ten minutes after you finally get the counter to order. We scope out the situation for a few minutes as the line continues to grow and our position moves forward only about four feet. Clearly ten minutes was a lie. I call another place, find out they have no wait, and we start walking back to our car. As we approach the vehicle, an unprompted farewell is called to us, ""Take care! Have a good morning!"" Honestly, I didn't know if the chipper employee was being rude or just didn't realize that we'd never actually entered the establishment. Either way, I don't really care.

They don't have any other size or anything but disposable cups.. Bit wasteful. Eggs Benedict came with  under cooked cooked sad hash browns and pancakes ok.. Syrup not the real maple deal which seems weird for a place claiming to be local and farm fresh. I see that claim so often these days and not sure everyone is sincere about that.

Scramble has a lot going for it.  I like the idea that it's brought a bit of new life to the Sunnyslope area.  It's great when a business sees potential for growth in an area others may not.  It's also got a clean, mod decor and local sourced products.  More wins for us all!  Four stars!

When it comes to the food, I wasn't especially impressed.  I ordered the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict (eggs, Jalapeno corn bread, cured ham & chipotle hollandaise) and while it was good, the only flavor standout was the cured ham.  It came with a side of just-above-room-temperature rosemary potatoes and while I could SEE a few specks of rosemary, I couldn't TASTE any rosemary.  While delivering the The Gouda Brizza (Eggs, smoked Gouda & applewood bacon) carryout order I placed for a friend, the aroma wafting through the car made me wonder if I'd made the wrong choice from the menu.  As it turns out, maybe I didn't.  I'm told it was OK for flavor, but the crust looked and tasted like a glorified cracker and there was no discernible flavor of gouda.  The service was fine, but could use a little more pep, considering people are there to jump start their day.  Three stars.

I can't say I'm completely disappointed in Scramble, but it could step it up a small notch when it comes to flavor/texture and price.  Breakfast pizza hasn't really caught on in PHX the way it has on the east coast.  Back east an entire (full size) breakfast pizza can be purchased for little more than the personal size available at Scramble.

It's completely gutted from when it was the other restaurant and has a very open but hipster feel to it. The menu is on boards as soon as you walk in and you go further up to place your order with the waitress. Number in hand, you sit anywhere and someone delivers the food when you're ready. I've been to places like that before but it's still a weird concept for a ""sit down"" place.
I got the Sunrise Sandwich which is basically runny eggs and ham with cheese on toast and a side of pan-fried rosemary seasoned potatoes. The sandwich was really good with plenty of ham and a lot of flavour but, and I say this as a potato lover, the potatoes were not edible. They were rubbery and flavourless like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all morning. This wouldn't bother me from a place like Denny's but if I'm going to be paying nearly $8 for something I can make at home at a fraction of the cost, I expect high quality and flavour.
Also tried the Italian coffee and cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was very fluffy and had a good helping of frosting on it. I liked that they didn't melt the frosting over it. The coffee was very good but a little costly at over $2 for self-serve no-frills coffee. Even Starbucks is cheaper than that. 

Overall, much left to be desired. Decent food but I've had more satisfying experiences at iHop at much better prices.  I can only assume all the high ratings are from people who aren't super into breakfast like me. It's my favourite meal so I know when it's lacking.

The meat lovers scramble was to die for...So why only 2 stars? The amount of food given i could have gotten double at my favorite breakfast spot for the price paid. they scramble maybe like 1 or 2 eggs and throw in some meat but it just did not seem like a reasonable price for how little was on my plate and i paid extra for a slice of french toast. if i would have known that the french toast wasn't as amazing as some people make it to be they do not know mouth watering french toast like i do. If you are craving french toast go to Crackers and Co. Not scramble! 
If i go to scramble again i would stick with the toast and potatoes with the scramble but i might try something else next time.  Then update my review. But for now i am sticking with the two stars for the taste of the meat lovers scramble.  I love how many hot sauces they had so it will give me more to experiment with next time.  Their rosemary potatoes are so much better than wildflower bread company whose are way too salty for my taste.  

Service was decent even though its not a real sit down place where people constantly check to see how you are doing. So service in general too me wasn't anything out of this world over the top status.

The place itself was clean and comfortable. But not for a long period of time. :)
Until then i wasn't so disappointed that i will never go again i am just not fond of how little food you get or think you will get for how much you spend. for $8 you get mostly bread and potatoes. Awesome right?

It was kind of a smallish omelet for the price. I've had bigger for maybe a $1 less at First Watch. It was still tasty though & they got it right with my strange additions. The side potatoes are ridiculously good too. They're perfectly crispy & tender with rosemary. Fantastic flavor.

Everything comes on white plastic type plates though. Hey, I guess if they get dropped they probably won't break.

I don't drink coffee but I love tea! How many freaking teas do they have?! Everywhere I turned there was tea & more tea. I tried 2 different iced kinds. I want to come back just for the tea.

By the drinks there's everything else you need to season or slather your breakfast with. Grape jelly, strawberry jelly, honey, sugar, hot sauces galore, etc. There's tabasco red & green. I believe the other kind they have is Cholula. I grabbed the chipotle flavor. 

There's a pretty big patio with shade. There was a woman eating breakfast with her small dog outside.

Noticed a few clocks telling time in different locations too. Cool thing to have.

This time, they still had disposable drink cups but I was very happy to see they were now a light plastic. I was soooo happy!

I got an egg sandwich, minus the ham and on a enflish muffin rather than sourdough bread. It was fantastic! Like a dream in my mouth. Cooked to perfection! I could've easily shared this with another diner, which was my first thought, but after one bite I just couldn't stop. Loved it.

I have been to Scramble probably 10 times in the last 6-8 months, and no one I have taken has ever had a bad meal. Not one. After finding out a friend of mine had never been, we headed north for breakfast nirvana

Right from the start, there was almost no wait to order. While I love Matt's downtown, the 1-2 hour wait during the summer is just too much. With Scramble, you may have a 5 minute wait to order, but that is about it. The layout of the place is really well done; it's always clean, plenty of room inside and out on the patio (which is pet-friendly), and you can grab all of your utensils, napkins, and beverages yourself. I usually get the Southwest burrito, which is amazing with chorizo/cheddar/avocado/eggs/jalapeno cream cheese, but today I wanted to mix it up. After considering the French French toast, I went a little more carb-light with the Meat-lovers scramble (bacon, ham, sausage in scrambled eggs with rosemary potatoes and toast).

The scramble was good but not great. I definitely enjoyed the eggs not being cooked too hard, and the meat was a great addition. I would say the ham and sausage were more enjoyable than the bacon, from which I just didn't get much flavor. There are times were the rosemary potatoes are a bit too seasoned, but these were cooked and served perfectly. I could hardly even eat my sourdough toast, but what I had was very good.

All around the table, we all had very good meals; two veggie scrambles were reported to be delicious and the Scramble virgin about destroyed his mushroom and bacon omelette. We decided to share a cinnamon roll; they are simply amazing. I believe the icing is sour cream based, which gives it a great tang, while the roll itself was cooked fresh.

Once again, Scramble delivered on every level. While I won't say the food is better than Matt's (probably the best breakfast I have ever had), I prefer Scramble almost every time, with no wait and simply amazing choices all over the menu., nan",Ryan,15,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

So walked in and didn't expect a fast food type of ordering system.......
Look at menu, walk to counter, order and pay, find a place to sit

So it was a lil awkward at first because I'm trying to skim through the menu quickly to order and not stand there like I'm looking at Xmas lights 
So went for the two eggs ur way with toast hashbrowns, bacon, dollar sized multi grain pancakes, and French toast.

All but hashbrowns were good. I wish they had country potatoes as an option. Hashbrowns had an oily aftertaste to them.

All in all would comeback ...loved d French toast but next time would educate myself w the menu so I can order right away

We tried the brizza (breafast pizza) with bacon and gouda, the gringo burrito, a cinnamon roll and coffee.  

The portions are generous - not usually a selling point for me, but it more than justifies the price, which for the burrito is about double the price at a 'berto's (pick a 'berto, any 'berto).  The brizza was excellent.  I'm looking forward to the leftover half for lunch.  The gringo burrito was indeed gringo-y as advertised; fresh eggs, cripy bacon, lots of melted cheese.  Red salsa on the side (I wonder if they have green?) Not being a  melted cheddar fan, I'll have to ask them to hold that next time.  Cinnamon role was servicable - not crazy carbs-be-damned  good, but tasty.  I look forward to making use of the expanded patio.

When we dine in, it's a mix. Their Costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently. I really like their mushroom and bacon omelet, but I also enjoy their ""two eggs anyway"" meal. I normally get scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fruit (instead of potatoes). Super delicious and filling. Another favorite are the Biscuits and Gravy. Now this is amazing! The biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. They just melt in your mouth! The gravy is the perfect accompaniment. It's thick and filled with sausage. These are some of the best B&Gs I've had!

Their Santa Fe style Eggs Benedic was great.  It's served with ham on jalapeno  corn bread and covered with a chipotle hollandaise sauce.  Rosemary potatoes are served on the side.  It wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be but it was delicious.  

The Costa burrito is also worth a mention as is the salsa it was served with.

I've only tried a handful of dishes from this place but they've always been quite good. The star of the show, in my opinion, is the brizza - a biscuit-dough breakfast pizza that I've been in love with since my first visit.

My first dining experience I ordered the Toluca brizza and it was incredibly good, although I will warn that the jalapeno cream cheese and the chorizo have a definite bite to them, so gringos beware! I've also had the Gouda brizza, and it was smoky and yummy, but I much prefer the Chicago, with a side of their awesome, stick-to-your-ribs sausage gravy as a dipping side.

Buttermilk biscuits and gravy are a meal unto themselves. The mushroom and bacon omelette is just dead-on, with garlic-sauteed mushrooms and chunks of thick-cut bacon.

Seating is comfortable but I will admit that the steel-tube chairs can pinch a bit, and that's probably the only reason I don't mark this as a 5 because breakfast\lunch places are the kinds of place where you stuff yourself and then linger for 20 minutes afterward, drinking soda or coffee and chatting.

When you enter you order at the counter, then you are given a number and wait for your meal at your table. 

I found the menu to offer a nice amount of delicious sounding meals. I debated between carmelized banana pancakes, vanilla peach pancakes, pigs in a blanket or one of the brizza's (breakfast pizza). Both my husband and I ordered brizza's. He got the gouda and bacon and I ordered the garlic spinach and mushroom pizza.

The wait for food was at least 20 minutes, but they were pretty busy this morning and seeing as they are pretty new I wasn't bothered. 

The brizza's were very tasty. I like how the scrambled egg was all thru out the pizza and not just a lump of eggs plopped on top of the pizza. The gouda and bacon pizza tasted similar to a breakfast sandwich. I found it to be a bit cheesy, but still good. 
The garlic spinach and mushroom pizza was also very good. I think the crust for the pizza's needs a bit more flavor, but it's not bad.

One this day Scramble was very busy and their beverage area is located in the middle of the restaurant and when this place is busy it becomes slightly unnerving to manuver around the drink area. 

I look forward to going back and trying out the pancakes and southwestern breakfast burrito.

Pretty much everything is ala carte. There really isn't a complete meal on the menu. The yummy french toast comes alone. Yeah, you get a lot of french toast, but really nearly $7 for just french toast? It should come with a side of bacon or hash browns. After you add a side your breakfast not including a drink is $10. I just think it's a tad high considering I could go most anywhere else and get a complete meal for less. 

I can't spend $30 on breakfast for me and my husband when A) we aren't getting full on meals and B) if I'm not getting any boozy breakfast drinks. Still, I do enjoy breakfast here., nan",Maggie,112,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

Walk-up ordering, with food runners that bring your meal out to you, and serve yourself beverages. It gets pretty packed here, but service is always friendly, pretty smooth, and very fast. 

Really varied menu, with everything from pizzas/wraps and other light lunch fare to traditional breakfast items, and an entire vegan brunch section! 

The vegan french toast is my go-to dish, but the soyrizo burrito is not bad, either (although it could do with more spice). The sweet potato hash that comes as a side is totally addicting-a perfect little combo of sweet potato and different types of squash. Vegan items come out on bright orange plates and they even carry vegan butter, etc. for your toast/bagel/whatever. Pretty neat. 

They offer coffee/espresso drinks, most of which are really way too syrupy sweet for my taste, but the house drip is actually really quite good, as are their iced teas. 

The patio here is amazing, even in the middle of the summer and winter-an unobtrusive misting system and sun shades keep it pretty nice (yes, thats relative) in the summer, and heat lamps warm it up in the winter.

I remember the food being good, but not outstanding. His was better than mine, but I think part of the reason that was so was because he had a really rich chipotle sauce on his.

Some things I love about this place:
1) The quality of their food as I just said. My favorite is their breakfast burritos.
2) The gourmet coffee station where you can get as many refills as you want when you want.
3) The way they streamline the ordering and seating process, which is usually a drudgery at other places. Here you order at the counter, choose your own seat and a waitress will bring you your food and check in with you at least a couple times to make sure there are no issues and that's it.
4) I like their use of windows letting in the natural sun light into the place. It makes for a pleasant and natural dining experience.
5-ish) I like that I can watch whatever game is on there, but as much as I like sports, they seem to have too many TV's. I mean they don't have to be everywhere and sometimes I want to get away from the tv and be in real life.

This is one of those places that I had to ignore my first impressions. My initial thought was 'oh dear, another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype"". And with it's wall menu and counter ordering, it is a trendy. But there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level. 

Between the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place. The drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus IMO. Yes, I have been accused of being a control freak in the past (and they say it like it's a bad thing...) but I love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee, suited for my tastes and mine alone. The tables, while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons. And even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim, I have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper. I also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room. There is literally something for everyone (and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with Ed Begley Jr. on GTV?!!). 

Now for the food. I've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites. On the top of that favorite list is the Gringo-Cherrywood bacon, egg & cheddar cheese Breakfast Burrito. This thing is large enough for two, or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg, meat, and cheese! Ask for extra salsa, because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy!!! The Brizzas (breakfast pizzas) and French Toast (baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard) are also tops on my list. As far as sides go, the Scramble Hash Browns are a must have! They seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection. I have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique... 

My only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders, your food may not be served at the same time. But this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order (not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate), that I can't really hold this against them. Then again, it may simply be that I have an addiction to those hash brown cakes! ; ) 

On-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place. 

This is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums, Scramble on over!, nan",Julie,167,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

I highly recommend doing an early morning hike at North Mountain, then heading straight there for breakfast. If you don't make it there before nine or so on weekends, the line will be pretty long, but don't worry, it moves fast. Once you get inside, the décor is simple and modern, with a bright, clean, open space and plenty of seating. There's also a nice patio when the weather is good. This is an order at the counter, get your own drinks, and seat yourself style place. Pretty awesome concept for a breakfast place, in my opinion. You can help yourself to your own coffee (they have a few different roasts and a variety of creamers) and hot sauce (great variety, though, sadly, lacking Sriracha). 

Everything on the menu looks so tasty that it's pretty tough to decide what to try, and so far everything I've ordered has been really good. My favorites are the veggie scramble (sun dried tomatoes, squash, peppers, & cheese with a side of rosemary potatoes and toast - really delicious toast) and any of their brizzas (breakfast pizza - fresh dough, scrambled egg, and toppings like sausage, chorizo, Gouda, &c).

Upon walk-up, there was a greeter at the door who, as we reached for the door handle and pulled it ajar, asked us if we were ""new here"" in which we told her we were. Then she proceeded into a lengthy, very rehearsed explanation at how the inside set up was going to work, all the while other guests were approaching the entrance too - including one a-hole who just squeezed in passed us as if I was holding the door open for him and after I called him out he said ""Well?! Im not new here!"". I barely could pay attention to her monologue while all of these other people passed us at the door, and finally we just thanked her barely comprehending what she had just said and went in to line up. This whole set up already gave us anxiety. 

Now we get to the cramped line at the door where you look at menu panels as you walk further in. To me, this isn't exactly the ideal set up as one can't see the entire menu to decide, you have to read them as you walk further in and people move out of your way. So far I am not getting the concept here. Like, I do get it, but I don't get it. It's a breakfast house, not a factory line. I don't like feeling I am being processed through a system when I go to eat. 

We ordered the Meat Lovers Scramble and the gringo Burrito. We thought the prices seemed a little much for it being a quick-order-and-eat breakfast place, but it has great reviews, so...

Yeah, the Meat Lovers, not so meaty. It was scrambled eggs and bacon and ham. Now that I look back at the menu, I realize it says here sausage too, ours had no sausage. It wasn't a very large portion, and having some limp, soggy hash browns aside and then wheat toast - we were recounting trips to IHOP being more satisfied with a similar order. And for $8.29? It's not to be mean, it's just true. My boyfriend was still hungry after this so I shared some of mine. 

The Gringo Burrito was really good. I would eat that again. I didn't expect much from scrambled eggs and bacon in a tortilla, but it was tasty. I feel like it needed the salsa and sour cream it came with sides of, but it was good. Realistically though, I could just make it at home. Hash browns, again, I've had a lot better (even at Denny's). That's a shame because good hash browns can save a boring breakfast dish. 

We saw someone going around and asking the tables how they were doing and if and what they liked, but no one came to our table or we would have shared.

Our meeting was running a bit long so I went back in and got a choc chip cookie after my zesty, savory chorizo Brizza.  It was just OK.  Nothing to write to Mrs. Tollhouse about, but not bad and fresh-baked today so it didn't taste like Saran wrap.  

The young woman at the counter was super helpful and helped me carry drinks outside for our table and bussed our table expeditiously as we were having a meeting which I appreciated. Everyone was super nice and it just had a great, chill, mellow, happy breakfasty vibe.

By the way, there were some vegan options on the menu online and the take out menus but not on the boards posted inside the place. 

Normally I would give 4 stars for a place with food this healthy and also good, but I was not wowed by the overall experience. First and foremost, it took forever for anything to come out - can't remember exactly how long but I remember thinking it was way too long for 2 simple plates. Even the coffee took forever to come out! The other thing is that it felt like I was sitting in a chain restaurant, which wasn't bad, but nothing special and probably contributed to the wait dragging on so long - nothing interesting about being there.

The fact that every single review does not focus solely on this morning opus to the Southwest confirms what I have always suspected: the dry heat has finally shriveled Phoenicians' tastebuds into tiny pieces of gravel. 

I kid, I kid. The Santa Fe is poached eggs and ham atop oh-so-yummy jalapeno cornbread, smothered in a chipotle hollandasie. It's got a kick, so isn't for the faint of mouth, and I can see where it might be a bit rich for some, but for me and my entree-splitting spouse, it's the best of the Southwest on a plate. 

I've also tried the caramel banana pancakes, the Scramble hash brown (think hash browns juicing on bacon and cheese), and the chorizo brizza (Brizza= breakfast+pizza. Get it?). The brizza was huge, and for me a huge miss. It made me feel sluggish and greasy just looking at it. Everything else? An A-OK. 

Scramble offers order-at-the-counter service and the interior is bright and cheery. They also have a dog-friendly patio where they're always sweet to my pup, who loves Scramble because of the fussing, fawning, big water bowl, and occasional dropped breakfast potato. 

Pros: Yumminess, fast service, cheerful interior, large patio, dog-friendly.

My mom got the veggie omelette.

Eggs had no seasoning and his steak was ""just full of pepper."" Bacon was ""undercooked"" with the plate drenched in oil. Doesn't the chef know you have to put the bacon on paper towel first? My burrito was ok. It barely had any soyrizo and had no kick to it. I was anticipating some spice as it indicated an icon of ""spicy"" next to the description.

It was not a long wait at all. About 5-7 minutes and I was sitting down just waiting on our food and drink.
I got the Sante Fe Eggs Benedict w/ side Scramble Browns, Scramble Latte to drink. 

It was really suprising with how busy it appeared how quickly the process was, our food arrived roughly another 5-10 min after sitting down. 
The Sante Fe Eggs are fantastic and although I believe they served me with more hollandaise sauce than usual I was not disappointed or somehow the chef knew what I wanted. The jalapeno cornbread has those little pieces of corn and jalapeno in it so you know they weren't messing around. The whole thing together tastes so good the jalapeno adds a sweetness beneath the usual flavors of the ham and egg. The chipotle hollandaise was crazy good, I had to get as much as that as I could on pretty much everything. The scramble browns were great on their own but hey a little hollandaise doesn't hurt. 

One thing. The menu states its spicy but I didn't so much as get a tingle of heat in my mouth. I suspect its a precautionary measure for those of the weaker fortitude but I recommend this to all. Don't be afraid of the spice, its nothing.

Overall, I cannot wait to come back and try their lunch paninis!



Also the staff were really friendly and nice. When we went they had someone offering small complimentary cups of coffee or OJ while waiting in line (they even had creamer!)., nan",Cameryn,21,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

However, my last experience will likely keep me away for good. With only one person taking breakfast orders, it took about 10 minutes to get to the counter. Scramble is one of the few places in the area that has more than one vegan option and I went for the vegan veggie scramble. While waiting, I found a seat in the too-close-for-comfort dining area and unsuccessfully tried to connect to the free wi-fi. I decided to move to the ""bar"" area (after extricating my flip flop from a blob of syrup that had cemented my foot to the floor), hoping to get a bit more space, but the stools are bolted to the ground and are so high my feet dangled (and I am not a short person). I moved yet again only to look up to see Fox News on the tv - not exactly what I want to see anytime of the day, let alone when I am eating! My food arrived quickly, but the aroma of the rosemary on the sweet potato hash was enough to make my stomach turn, not to mention it looked like a large hockey puck. The tofu scramble was edible only after being doused in hot sauce. The sourdough toast was good, but they do bread-type things well here, so that was no surprise.

I have eaten her several times, and have had a few things off of the menu. I highly recommend the brizzas, breakfast pizzas. They are delicious and they are always good. The other items that I have tried have been hit or miss. 

The Gouda brizza is made with smoked gouda and apple smoked bacon. What can be wrong with that combo? Absolutely nothing! I have also had The Toluca. It has chorizo, peppers, cheese, and jalapeno cream cheese. This brizza is so good, but very rich. 

I have also had the three cheese omelet. The first time I had it the omelet, it was brown, dry, and inedible. I sent it back and the replacement was excellent. The truth is the rosemary potatoes were the best thing about the meal. 

This morning I work up with a craving for pancakes. So, I ordered the multigrain pancakes. When they arrived they looked great. However, when I took my first bite I was so disappointed. I went back and looked at the menu, and there was no mention that these were cinnamon pancakes. There was so much cinnamon in these pancakes that they were nearly inedible. Imagine chewing 2 sticks of Big Red chewning gum and taking a bite of pancake. That is what it tasted like. The cinnamon taste actually took my breath away. I couldn't finish them. They left a horrible after taste in my mouth. I love cinnamon, but just not in my pancakes. If I had known that these were cinnamon pancakes, I wouldn't have ordered them. 

I am sure that I will go back to Scramble, but I am pretty sure I will not order the pancakes again. They should really revise the menu to mention that these are cinnamon pancakes., nan",Mark,27,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

This is the place! Large menu with all sorts of items from breakfast burritos to eggs benedict, to pancakes and French toast.  Their food is high-quality and they source their breads, vegetables and meats locally.  The only disappointment was the biscuits and gravy and cinnamon roll. Both were dry and cold. The cinnamon roll had frosting on top but it did not even melt as there was no heat from the roll to melt it. And the biscuits and gravy was dense, cold, and not as flavorful as I had hoped. . Definitely looking forward to coming back again though!

UPDATE: Gave this place another chance today. The cinnamon roll that I had today was perfect! Lots of flavor and nice and warm. However, I am still not a big fan of the biscuits and gravy. There is nothing wrong with them. It is just my personal taste. The gravy is quite thick and he biscuit is dense. Again, just a personal opinion. I did try the flatbread breakfast pizza today though.

I order the mushroom, bacon and jack cheese omelette, it was presented nicely with rosemary potatoes and toast. Toast was burned but replaced quickly. My mister
ordered a BLT with Applewood bacon on a fresh baquette. Standard fare, but  well done.  American coffee was excellent. How great that I could get breakfast at noon.

Upon entering, we found ourselves in a long line of yelper foodies in the same situation as we were. The decor is modern and the ordering set up is like a fast food joint: wait in line, order, find a seat and wait for your food. The wait was about 20 minutes and there are tvs set up to enjoy while waiting at your table. Although important, these details are not by any means the reason for a two star review. The food and the pricing was actually a bit over hyped. Our meal, for two people, cost almost $30 and the portions were VERY small. I ordered the baguette french toast which was chewy, tasty, and pretty small. This dish is an off shoot from traditional french toast which and was ordinary at best. The bacon that accompanied this dish was very good and you only get two slices. I also ordered a side of rosemary potatoes for around $3 which were dry and cold. My girlfriend got the meat lovers scramble and considering the name of the restaurant, we figured this breakfast would be a sure shot. Well it wasnt. The scramble was skimpy, dry, bland, light on the meat, and came with the same rosemary potatoes and hard cold toast. Also, we were very dissappointed with the cinnamon roll because it did not look anything like it did in the picture. It was dry and slathered with overpowering cream cheese frosting. The only saving grace for this place was the orange juice, which seemed to be freshly squeezed, and the coffee.

No doubt, this joint has a lot of great options for everyone, even if you feel like splurging.

Unfortunately, it was difficult finding a clean table to sit down at. It was just before noon on a Monday when we stopped in to eat, so I was a little surprised that it was already that messy. The floors definitely needed sweeping and the bathroom sink wasn't draining when I used it. 

The customer service was a little odd. My boyfriend told me that the person who brought the food over to the table while I was in the restroom was condescending about the fact that we didn't get our own silverware. Honestly, we just had no idea we were supposed to pick up our own by the soda fountain. It was our first time eating here! On the contrary, the person working the register was very helpful and polite. 

The food was alright. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict, served with hash browns. The hollandaise sauce kind of reminded me of the packet version that you add butter and water to. I'm not saying that it didn't taste good, but almost seemed like something I could have made myself plus they used a little too much of it on the dish. The hash browns were served cold and under cooked so I barely touched them.

We were warmly greeted at the door by an employee and entered their restaurant to the typical hustle and bustle of a breakfast eatery. Scramble has a hip modern feel that is still warm and welcoming, and they pride themselves on using local farmers and vendors when possible.  With their counter service style it's speedier than a typical restaurant but there's still no feel of rush.

Two things that stand out to me the most:

- The presentation of the food

- The outside patio

On Saturday morning, went with a friend of mine. Line was long but goes pretty fast. This is big turn on for me as I hate the long waits I find at more mainstream breakfast oriented restaurants . I just like to sit down and relax in the morning as soon as possible. Decided to go with the Veggie Omelet this time, friend went with a bagel with cream cheese and salmon. We made our way to the outside patio and sat down facing the mountains. Perfect weather this morning had to do it and as stated above one of the reasons why this place gets good marks from me. Food arrived after about 10 minutes which is reasonable, and left good opportunity for conversation with my company. 

Veggie omelet came with four slices of whole wheat french toast and potato wedges. I sprinkled some Tapatio hot sauce all around which you can grab at this kiosk type thing on the inside. Omelet was delicious, no complaints there. Potato wedges were also divine, just crisp enough and full of flavor. Hit the spot just right and the portion was also just right. I think this is important. If the food isn't taking up all the space on the plate I don't have the compulsion to eat it all or waste it. It's just a pet peeve of mine and Scramble does a good job of giving just enough to satisfy. 

The final point I want to make about Scramble and why it's one of the few places I travel to in this ungodly hour is because you don't get bothered. You buy your food, you grab your utensils/condiments, sit down and the food it brought to you. It's simple. It's easy. And the food is somewhat healthy. My rating is close to a 4.5 only because it's not the best breakfast food I've ever had but the environment and service bring it's close to a 5 star.

With all that said, I would highly recommend Scramble., nan",Rafael,11,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

I ordered the vegan French Toast and a coffee (self-serve) which went perfectly well together and were both absolutely delicious. The French Toast came with a side of fresh fruit, vegan butter, and syrup. Highly impressed that they have individual packets of vegan butter, as I have yet to see that in many restaurants.

I was there on Saturday around 9:00am and there were close to 30 people in line but only a single cash register open. Most of the seats were still available inside but the management only had a single person taking orders and a bunch of staff waiting around. Either they don't know their business or they have trouble running a business since they happens repeatedly.

My other beef with them are the hugely uncomfortable metal chairs that are inside. My god, these are the most uncomfortable chairs that I have ever sat in! While they look nice, they were clearly bought by a short person with an ample sized rear end. For everyone else, the chairs are agony to sit in.

CpWtmwMs4bgTzhVMzXrryQ,XHr5mXFgobOHoxbPJxmYdg,2014-12-25,0.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,"First of all, let me state that I usually don't do reviews, generally. However I was looking for a breakfast place on Christmas Day, and you know how that is. Most are closed or if open, they are usually the typical chains that are in many cities. I was looking for another place other than one of the chains since the one I was currently at was very busy, I came across Scramble on an internet search. It was a ways away from where I was but since it was one of those days when I wouldn't have much in choices, I decided to give it a try. I did call them and make sure how late they were open. I have a couple hours before they closed since they closed at 2 p.m. (On this particular day.)

Ok, Food first: I am generally at really picky eater.
You know, I like my hash browns not too crispy but not too soft, like my eggs with the white cooked but the middle semi cooked, you know the usual, what you usually can't find. However when I arrived at Scramble I was a little concerned since it is the cafeterias type where you walk up to the counter and order, they give you a tag with a number on it to put on the table you chose so they can bring the order to you. Not typically my style!

I have to say though, this is a bit different.  I was treated by Sherry, who was very bubbly, considerate, intuitive, and helpful, in fact I thought at first she was one of the owners since her attitude just seem to reflect that. More on that later. She assisted me with the order since I never been there before, even suggesting a hash brown patty that I found out was excellent later. I ordered coffee and water also &  was given cups so I could go to an island & serve myself. By the way their Italian roast is an excellent coffee. I like it strong, and it was but not with a bite or an aftertaste, smooth but strong! My type of coffee!

Ok. Food:
They had excellent choices, many healthy choices as well as many just good & tasty! The portions we're good. Average but we're proportionately correct for the price. I happen to like to eat a lot in one sitting so it was a little less than I normally like but still filled me up fine! It should be noted that it was served on a real plate and was presented very nicely on that plate. It took no more than 10 minutes after I ordered it so they were very quick. It was very tasty with a lot of distinguishable variations in my scramble, in other words, someone knew how to cook back there to make sure the taste blended well with one another. I don't recall exactly which scramble I ordered but it did have a combination of eggs, cheese, red pepper, onions and probably a few other things in there. I also had the hash brown patty which was excellent and it came with a side of toast in a twist of orange.

So let's talk about the service a moment. Like I said earlier,  the one that took my order Sherry, is one of the managers, along with her managing partner Mike. Both excellent.

 First of all she was very professional and yet enthusiastic, with a ""Glad You Are Here"" attitude, which, in consideration it was a holiday, was very impressive since most employees would want to be at home with your family on that day. However you would never know that from her attitude or from the way she worked; even cleaning and bussing tables enthusiastically, and with a smile, interaction between employees and customers, and even catching my eye when I looked up at her with a question. Of which she immediately responded.  She is very good at what she does. I had some questions on the coffee since I liked it.  By the way, they do sell it there and her and the other manager Mike, answered all my questions professionally and efficiently. Mike even listened to some of my suggestions about coffee since I have a little bit of experience behind that. Which also reflected his excellent managerial quality.

I also noticed that the rest of the employees had smiles and were busy working which is probably a reflection of the managerial staff. Like I mentioned earlier I assumed they were owners, but when I spoke to Sherry expressing that I thought they were the owners, (With Mike standing next to her), they both stated that they were just the managers but to look forward to someday perhaps being owners of place such as this.

I also noticed that they both, when you spoke to them, give you their full attention and eye contact. This is very important in managers, people want to know that you are listening to them whether they have a problem which simply want to express their likes or dislikes. Sherry and Mike did this excellently. Obviously both of them set an example to the fellow employees to make the difference for this place and all of this being done on a holiday when you would expect them to want to be home.

Alright, I don't know who the owners are, I do hope they read this review.  I want to qualify couple things. First I do not know Sherry or Mike, I have never known them, until I met them at this restaurant. Excellent employees & place!!, nan",P,2,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

Often when I have breakfast out I end up feeling over sated and a little greasy: from the eggs and potatoes or the extra rich pancakes.  I didn't feel that way at all after eating at Scramble.  I had an excellent veggie scramble  with good sourdough toast.  The coffee was a strong, dark roast that I enjoyed, though a little too strong for me to love it.  There's free WiFi and a cheerful atmosphere.  It's casual dining (order at the counter, food brought to your table).  I wish there was a Scramble close to my home in California.

First off, let me say that I applaud the pay-first, seat yourself business model and the neighborhood enterprise spirit. The staff and management seem cheerful and eager to please. However there are a few things that really ought to be attended to. 

1) High-shine metallic finish outdoor tables. Since this is in fact a breakfast joint and, as is its custom, the sun comes up in the east (as the owners perhaps noted as they were remodeling the former Peeps), and the patio faces east, couldn't they have also noticed that patrons can go blind from the glare of the high-tech looking eating surface of their patio tables? Clearly, management was going for a clean, shiny, polished metal look, but really, many of the tables become simply unusable as the sun climbs over the horizon. 

2) My dining companion and I attempted to sit outside at 8:30 am on a beautiful early June Sunday only to find our ears assaulted by pounding disco tunes from the overhead speakers on the patio. Sure, we could have moved to another table, but the only available tables with overhead umbrellas would be blinding us with the glare of the reflected morning sun (from the east, y'know). We realized that management probably just used a standard playlist...but didn't anyone check to see (a) the volume outside, and (b) the actual playlist? The music would have been perfectly suitable for a dance club at 9pm...but not for a breakfast place. 

3) Since the restaurant fronts busy 7th St, would it kill them to plant a few shrubs or trees as a sound and sight barrier to an otherwise nasty view? Or maybe that's what the pounding disco music was supposed to counteract. 

4) I know Scramble is getting high marks for their innovative menu, but I grade a breakfast place on one item: how much care they take with a simple item like an English muffin. I'm sure omelets and specialty items are delightful. But the toast or muffin at a breakfast place is often treated as a throw-away, a garnish. Not for me. If the cook-staff can't even toast a muffin without turning it into cardboard, I'm not going to be too impressed with their other fare. The muffin I had would have made a perfectly good coaster for a drink -- flat, hard and dry -- but it was not a food item., nan",Jim,1,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St

KeMlMJ8HJIPM9wAhw3mGlQ,XHr5mXFgobOHoxbPJxmYdg,2012-07-14,1.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,"OMG. What trippy breakfast experience. Someone has teleported Walt Disney's automated breakfast restaurant of the future right out of Epcot Center and on to North 7th Street in Phoenix.

Hop on the ride at the door where you pass the menu on the wall. Read fast because this ride doesn't stop. Don't lose your place in line! It's all about queuing here at Disney.

Give your order to the orange, expressionless, automaton robot-babe. Receive a number. Find a table and wait for Disney Magic to happen as dozens of orange robot-babes rush about delivering platters, busing plates and hauling coffee urns.

Tables full? Don't worry. Crowd management is covered here at Disney/Scramble. When tables are full, one or two order taking orange robot-babes shut down to reduce the flow into the restaurant. At Disney, everyone gets to the front of the line...and to their share of the breakfast magic...sooner or later.

The food? Utterly soulless, just like the robot-babes.

Rosemary potatoes? Yup. There's potato. There's rosemary. Can't argue with that. 

Scramble browns? Perfectly formed circle. Browned dark on one side; light on the other. Don't like it too dark? Turn it over!

Multigrain pancakes? Multigrained? Yup. Pancake? Yup. Perfectly round? Yup. Consistently sized? Yup. Too much cinnamon to cover the bland basic mix? Yup. Lots of syrup? Yup!!! Robot-babe, bring more syrup! I say these pancakes are just as good as any frozen Eggo product you're going to find!

Poached egg? It was poached. Nice yellow yolk, just like the safe eggs from Safeway. Served in a nice little cup to keep them from running all over your plate.

Scramble Latte? Super sugary!

Coffee? Yes. Bold option? Bold! Regular option? Regular!

ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! Someone call Hyatt Place. The orange robot-babes have stolen all their square white plates. They are the perfect dishes for the automated restaurant of the future: unbreakable, stackable, space-saving, and easy to load and remove from an automated dish washing system!

Got a group? No problem! All the tables are sized for two and are portable so they can be moved all around the restaurant to provide seating for a couple, a family or even a whole book club! Be careful though. I would advise against creating any unique arrangements, say such as lining up tables on a 45-degree angle. I suspect the robot-babes could not compute. The entire restaurant could spin out of control and crash. Experiment with caution.

Folks, this food is every bit as good as the ""free breakfast"" you can get at La Quinta, Holiday Inn Express and Hyatt Place and better automated. Plus you get orange robot-babes! If you like your hotel breakfast, you're gonna LOVE this place., nan",Paul,17,"['Breakfast & Brunch', 'Vegan', 'Restaurants']",Scramble A Breakfast Joint,"9832 N 7th St
